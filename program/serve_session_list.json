However, CytoCave introduces a range of new features that facilitate the exploration of multi-omics networks using di- mensionality reduction projections of high-dimensional biological data with cluster membership highlighting, and includes scalabil- ity upgrades to support visualizing and interacting with large scale proteomics and multi-omics datasets. The CytoCave project source code, which includes the web application JavaScript and the data processing pipeline Jupyter notebook, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/iMammal/CytoCave. In this paper, we describe how to use CytoCave to facilitate the following proteomics and drug discovery tasks. CytoCave enables users: (Task 1) to select a protein and analyze drugs that target them, or, similarly, (Task 2) to select a drug and visualize the proteins that are strongly associated with the drug response. Additionally, CytoCave re-designs the traditional 2D force-directed layout visu- alization of protein interaction networks, providing an interactive interface that allows users to pan, rotate, and zoom in and out of the network, and to switch layouts and color coding templates from a variety of pre-calculated options, with optional pop-up annotations on mouse hovers and edge display / edge hiding on mouse clicks.","authors":[],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Morris Chukhman"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","session_id":"c1","slot_id":"a-biomedchallenge-7741","time_end":"2023-10-23T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"CytoCave: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Exploring Protein and Drug Interaction Networks","uid":"a-biomedchallenge-7741","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"We present a visual analytics framework, PepProEx, for unraveling peptide and protein interactions.

To overcome these problems, we present ProtEGOnist, a novel, interactive visualization approach designed to explore PPI networks with a focus on drug-protein associations.

These ego-graphs are aggregated into an ego-graph network, where edges between ego-graphs encoded their similarity using the Jaccard index. Our proposed visualization design offers an overview of drug-associated proteins, radar charts to compare protein functions, and detailed ego-graph subnetworks for interactive exploration.

However, these new capabilities do not address the memory constraints of lightweight end-user devices encountered when attempting to visualize the massive data sets produced by today\u2019s simulations and data acquisition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel implicit isosurface rendering algorithm for interactive visualization of massive volumes within a small memory footprint. We achieve this by progressively traversing a wavefront of rays through the volume and decompressing blocks of the data on-demand to perform implicit ray-isosurface intersections. The progressively rendered surface is displayed after each pass to improve interactivity. Furthermore, to accelerate rendering and increase GPU utilization, we introduce speculative ray-block intersection into our algorithm, where additional blocks are traversed and intersected speculatively along rays as other rays terminate to exploit additional parallelism in the workload. Our entire pipeline is run in parallel on the GPU to leverage the parallel computing power that is available even on lightweight end-user devices. We compare our algorithm to the state of the art in low-overhead isosurface extraction and demonstrate that it achieves 1.7\u00d7\u20135.7\u00d7 reductions in memory overhead and up to 8.4\u00d7 reductions in data decompressed.","authors":["Will Usher","Landon Dyken","sidharth kumar"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Landon Dyken"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Interactive full-resolution isosurface visualization of the 2048x2048x1920 Richtmyer-Meshkov (R-M) data set in the browser.

However, this rapid growth in model and simulation size has outpaced the capabilities of input/output (I/O) operations. Consequently, the conventional approach of saving and outputting data to persistent storage for analysis has become increasingly challenging, limiting the benefits of these advanced models. To address this challenge, we present a method for effectively handling massive-scale simulation data, ensuring its persistence at full spatial and temporal resolution for flexible post hoc analysis. We employ an in situ approach that captures interprocess communicated data, compressing cached data to a fraction of the overall simulation domain. We successfully reconstruct subdomains at full spatial and temporal resolution during post-processing through communication-free rerun using the cached halos. We detail the storage requirements of the new approach and demonstrate the substantial reductions in computational resources required to precisely recapitulate data within a local region of interest.","authors":["Ayman Yousef","Amanda Randles","Erik Draeger"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Ayman Yousef"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","session_id":"ae2","slot_id":"a-ldav-1003","time_end":"2023-10-23T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"Low-Cost Post Hoc Reconstruction of HPC Simulations at Full Resolution","uid":"a-ldav-1003","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"As the compute capabilities of the modern supercomputers continue to rise, domain scientists are able to run their simulations at very fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Compared to the compute speeds, the I/O bandwidth continues to lag by orders of magnitude. This necessitates that the analysis and data reduction are performed in situ while the simulation generated data is still at the supercomputer memory. Recently, intelligent data-driven sampling schemes have been proposed by visualization researchers. These sampling methods are scalable, in situ capable and able to identify the feature regions of the data. Although powerful, these sampling schemes need to traverse through the data sets at least twice, which can become problematic as the simulations start to touch the exascale capabilities. In this paper, we propose to use a reinforcement learning-based approach to devise a sub-linear time sampling algorithm. Using multi-arm bandits, we show that we can identify samples that are of similar or better quality compared to the existing methods while only touching a small fraction of the original data. We use multiple simulation data sets to show the efficacy of our proposed method.","authors":["Ayan Biswas","Arindam Bhattacharya","Yi-Tang Chen","Han-Wei Shen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/a-ldav/a-ldav-1013/a-ldav-1013_Preview.mp4?token=4h_VlQ7M850UVVS5kreyl-LrYrNyrNjiMojRODezE3I&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/a-ldav/a-ldav-1013/a-ldav-1013_Preview.vtt?token=Se5ED8JaBlBWa5oDTfBKwiabOMdclA-gGFPV_FFT9TE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Ayan Biswas"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We propose a reinforcement learning-based intelligent sampling scheme using multi-arm bandits.

The technique introduces a lighting system that accounts for global shadows across distributed MPI nodes while using shared-memory parallelism within each node to compute shading information efficiently. The first stage of the approach involves estimating energy attenuation from a point light source through the global volume, using a reduced spatial resolution representation of the volume, with minimal global communication between nodes. It is then used in the second stage during volume rendering to shade sample points captured during ray-casting, generating a high-quality image. In this work, we study the technique's performance across varying spatial resolutions of the estimated light attenuation using synthetic and real-world volumetric data sets on distributed systems.","authors":["Manish Mathai","Matthew C Larsen","Hank Childs"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Manish Mathai"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Volume renderings of four data sets using shadows.

The mesh of tensor products adjoins in irregular fashion to tessellate the entire domain, with high-degree continuity across tensor product boundaries. The result is that regions of refinement, with additional knots and control points, are localized to individual tensor products rather than extending throughout the entire domain. The model attains similar accuracy with fewer total control points than a single tensor product model, at the cost of added computational complexity to manage the continuity and accuracy across tensor products. We describe our high-dimensional data organization and demonstrate how to approximate scientific datasets using our data model. Size and speed are compared between a single tensor product and our representation. Initial results demonstrate correct functionality and modest reduction in the number of control points required to attain comparable accuracy as a single tensor, with increased computation time as expected. Our initial findings indicate two avenues for future research: additional tuning of the adaptive refinement algorithm to reduce size further, and accelerating computation through parallelism.","authors":["Tom Peterka","David Lenz","Iulian Grindeanu Iulian Grindeanu","Vijay S.

This paper addresses the challenge of identifying the most reliable tools for completing a knowledge graph. Additionally, the paper tackles the issue of identifying companies potentially involved in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. To aid in this endeavor, we introduce a web application designed to detect temporal patterns associated with companies that halt operations and reemerge with new identities. By aggregating data monthly and strategically displaying AI-generated bundle nodes using dropdown controls, our analysis uncovers suspicious patterns, particularly within the Chub Mackerel context. Notably, the Shark and Lichen bundles emerge as dependable graph-completion tools.

The mission of this endeavor is to use audible and visual media to allow humans to uncover and cognize with the always surrounding, yet invisible, Solar System. Each planet's unique data patterns (sidereal periods) contribute to this exploration by being translated with audible and visible media. The media stimulate audiences' cognitive senses, enabling audiences to tangibly experience the aesthetic wonder of the cosmic world, which is deeply interconnected with the entirety of the Universe and humanity on Earth. The inspiration and message of the Solar System project resonate with this year's theme, Perpetual Presence. Throughout history, data from the Universe has been employed to uncover the existence of unseen worlds, the Cosmos. The discoveries gleaned from the process have influenced numerous sectors of our humanity, communicated through a multitude of languages and approaches. Scientists use numerical data and textual explanations to communicate information about the Cosmos. On the other hand, artists use sensory media, such as visuals and sounds, to narrate the story of the Cosmos.

Sound is created by the data of the decomposition of plastics. Different types of plastics and speed of decomposition determine the frequency, amplitude, and parameters of audio synthesis. This scene animation is inspired by Ilwalobongbyeong (a folding screen) behind the king\u2019s throne of the Joseon Dynasty. This animation depicts the twist of the landscape. Surreal objects/buildings in this animation made out of plastic look beautiful and mesmerizing at first glance.

Drawing from DICOM data to simulate the human body and nebulae, we create an interactive and dynamic virtual environment. The real-time bio-data of users, collected via heart rate sensors and EEG devices, is integrated into the visualization, fostering a personal engagement and unity within this 'cosmos.' Body Cosmos provokes curiosity and expands users' imagination, and deepens their understanding of life's macrocosm and microcosm. This exploratory project redefines traditional perceptions of the human body in relation to the universe, creating a unique lens to view selfhood, embodiment, and identity. As we look to the future, the system's evolution will include incorporation of more bio-data sensors, an investigation into its potential psychological and physiological benefits, and the development of social interactive features through multi-user capabilities.","authors":["Rem RunGu Lin","Yongen Ke","Kang Zhang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/a-visap/a-visap-1029/a-visap-1029_Preview.mp4?token=aPYXA8zG2zE9drtnbryLWnT5kozZvUaQMToRBmysaAA&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/a-visap/a-visap-1029/a-visap-1029_Preview.vtt?token=aS11gJ_XnNecukOxKHJiVPFZ27XV5GtZwVpAgeOEUho&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/a-visap/a-visap-1029/a-visap-1029_Presentation.mp4?token=BZzDOW8KxT2r1NzVtFMRqqnx0ZZDCIJ15MGuFhrTROk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/a-visap/a-visap-1029/a-visap-1029_Presentation.vtt?token=gX2HUY44ic1VDvTY_4aNRQJ6lpfzqT9Tij2rOZZImiU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Rem RunGu Lin"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Screenshot of Unreal Engine\u2019s real-time demo (\u00a9 Rungu Lin 2023)","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-1029","time_end":"2023-10-25T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-24T23:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-24T23:45:00Z","title":"Body Cosmos: An Immersive Experience Driven by Real-Time Bio-Data","uid":"a-visap-1029","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"zxoVAVrkR8s","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/zxoVAVrkR8s"},{"abstract":"We are perpetually present in our environment, experiencing it with our senses. Scientific data describes the same environment quantitatively. Our goal is to use scientific and artistic methods to combine these environmental expressions and personal experience through the creation of glyphs visually abstracted from and associated with forms in nature in the representation of climate data. The use of these glyphs removes the distinctions between scientific data and sensory experience, to allow a fuller intuitive association between the two, creating an embodied experience and increasing awareness of the climate effects and changes all around us.","authors":["Francesca Samsel","Greg Abram","Catherine L.

For the purposes of this exhibition, the 10 pages of the book are individually placed on a wall in a linear fashion, each with their own UV flashlight. The viewers are able to interact with each page by going through a tunnel-shaped space created by placing a dark curtain from the ceiling in front of the wall. The book itself is placed outside, at the entrance of this tunnel, for display.

Alfaguara, 2021; Caja Negra, 2023), by Chilean author Sim\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Trujillo, a mycologist analyzes the way a certain fungus infects the mind of a forest worker called Pedro. In one moment, an abstract image, of countless white dots against a black background, in the form of waves or a mountain range, appears to explain the infection: the genetic origin of the language of Pedro, when the fungus starts speaking through him.  That image, included in the revised edition of the book, is also a depiction of the novel\u2019s genetic origin, as it was generated by a visualization of different drafts of the novel. In every literary reading, two texts are involved: the written or actual text, that we can smoothly read with our eyes, and a second text, imperceptible and invisible, made of all the deletions, editions, and additions of words involved in the process of writing the text. This project conceives the visualization of The Vast Territory as a visual novel on its own that explores the unconscious of the book: that black, secret space, where the words involved during the writing process emerge as ghostly presences. There, the data of the previous draft are manifested in the following one, as a latent presence in the actuality of the text we read. The work, where every white dot represents a word in the juxtaposed draft sequence, is a two-dimensional pixel-based text visualization. Its construction follows only two straightforward rules: (1) words are sequentially arranged in a horizontal line; (2) the vertical position of each word-dot is determined by its initial appearance within the entire sequence of drafts. The result is a \u201cdata-palimpsest\u201d where each draft leaves its imprint on the next through their cumulative determination of the spatial order. By using the order of first appearance as the guiding principle, the visualization emphasizes the inherited structure of each draft from its predecessors, akin to looking at the fossil record or geological strata, with the most ancient elements appearing at the greatest depth. The layer on top, where the words are shown, allows the viewer to inspect the content at each point in time, which is indicated by a thin vertical line or by the \u201cfolding\u201d of the canvas. It acts as a zoom-in, where the overlaid words are placed at their precise height in the visualization, or first-appearance depth.","authors":["Ignacio P\u00e9rez-Messina","Sim\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Trujillo"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Ignacio P\u00e9rez-Messina"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","session_id":"visap2","slot_id":"a-visap-1040","time_end":"2023-10-26T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T23:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T23:45:00Z","title":"The Vast Territory","uid":"a-visap-1040","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"The data sculpture \"Monster in a Snowglobe\" offers a distant reading perspective on the life and work of the Austrian painter Herwig Zens (1943-2019).

These devices ship with custom software, dubbed firmware, whose development may not have followed strict security-by-design guidelines and for which no detailed documentation may be available. Given their critical role, testing their software before deploying them is crucial. Software fuzzing is a popular software testing technique that has shown to be quite effective in the last decade. However, the firmware may contain thousands of subcomponents with unexpected interplays. Moreover, operators may have a tight time budget to perform a security evaluation, requiring focused fuzzing on the most critical subcomponents. Also, considering the lack of accurate documentation for a device, it is quite hard for a security operator to understand what to fuzz and how to fuzz a specific device firmware. In this paper, we present FuzzPlanner, a visual analytics solution that enables security operators during the design of a fuzzing campaign over a device firmware. FuzzPlanner helps the operator identify the best candidates for fuzzing using several innovative visual aids. Our contributions include introducing FuzzPlanner, exploring diverse analytical tools to pinpoint critical binaries, and showing its efficacy with two real-world firmware image scenarios.","authors":["Emilio Coppa","Alessio Izzillo","Riccardo Lazzeretti","Simone Lenti"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Alessio Izzillo"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"FuzzPlanner is a visual tool that assists security operators in designing fuzzing campaigns for device firmware.

However, their limitations, such as susceptibility to attacks, especially weak passwords defined by human users, are well-documented. The existence of weak human-defined passwords has led to repeated password leaks from websites, many of which are of large scale. While such password leaks are unfortunate security incidents, they provide security researchers and practitioners with good opportunities to learn valuable insights from such leaked passwords, in order to identify ways to improve password policies and other security controls on passwords. Researchers have proposed different data visualisation techniques to help analyse leaked passwords. However, many approaches rely solely on frequency analysis, with limited exploration of distance-based graphs. This paper reports PassViz, a novel method that combines the edit distance with the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding) dimensionality reduction algorithm [19] for visualising and analysing leaked passwords in a 2-D space. We implemented PassViz as an easy-to-use command-line tool for visualising large-scale password databases, and also as a graphical user interface (GUI) to support interactive visual analytics of small password databases. Using the \u201c000webhost\u201d leaked database as an example, we show how PassViz can be used to visually analyse different aspects of leaked passwords and to facilitate the discovery of previously unknown password patterns. Overall, our approach empowers researchers and practitioners to gain valuable insights and improve password security through effective data visualisation and analysis.","authors":["Samuel Charles Parker","Haiyue Yuan","Shujun Li"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Mr Samuel Charles Parker"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Examples of visualisation of different clusters for 000webhost leaked password database","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","session_id":"ae4","slot_id":"a-vizsec-8322","time_end":"2023-10-22T06:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T03:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T03:00:00Z","title":"PassViz: An Interactive Visualisation System for Analysing Leaked Passwords","uid":"a-vizsec-8322","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"The complexity of distributed manufacturing and software development coupled with the increasing prevalence of cyber and supply chain attacks necessitates a greater understanding of the hardware and software components that comprise equipment in critical infrastructure. When a vulnerability in a single software library can have disastrous consequences, being able to identify where that library may exist in equipment or software becomes a prerequisite for protecting the overall infrastructure. This need has sparked a large effort around the development and incorporation of bill-of-materials(BOM) into security, asset management, and procurement practices to aid in mitigating, and responding to future attacks. While much of the current research is devoted to creating BOMs, it is equally important to develop methods for comparing them to answer questions, such as: How has my software changed? Are two pieces of equipment equivalent? Does this piece of equipment that just arrived match my historical information? In this work, we demonstrate how BOMs can be represented by graph structures.  We then describe how these structures can be fed into a graph comparison algorithm to produce a novel interactive visualization that allows us to not only identify differences in BOMs but show exactly where they are in the product.","authors":["Rebecca Jones","Lucas

With the increasing availability of large-scale individual-level census data, new analytical opportunities arise for social scientists to explore human behaviors (e.g., political engagement) among social groups at a fine-grained level. However, traditional statistical methods mostly focus on global, aggregated spatial correlations, which are limited to understanding and comparing the impact of local environments (e.g., neighborhoods) on human behaviors among social groups.  In this study, we introduce a new analytical framework for analyzing multi-variate neighborhood effects between social groups. We then propose NeighViz, an interactive visual analytics system that helps social scientists explore, understand, and verify the influence of neighborhood effects on human behaviors.

Rather than focusing on interesting combinations of their data, users have to spend time creating each chart in a dashboard one by one. This makes dashboard creation slow and tedious. We conducted a review of production metrics dashboards and found that many dashboards contain a common structure: breaking down one or more metrics by different dimensions. In response, we developed a high-level specification for describing dashboards as sections of metrics repeated across the same dimensions and a graphical interface, Quick Dashboard, for authoring dashboards based on this specification. We present several usage examples that demonstrate the flexibility of this specification to create various kinds of dashboards and support a data-first approach to dashboard authoring","authors":["Will Epperson","Kanit Wongsuphasawat","Allison Whilden","Fan Du","Justin Talbot"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1017/s-vds-1017_Preview.mp4?token=XJ7keJrB1CZHMphUA4SegluO0FDrl7Jq2oG0Q1e7Kdw&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1017/s-vds-1017_Preview.vtt?token=XzoHl07eUhYr5Y88-v4tCXeSWdazRL6rtLdtj-xMa34&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1017/s-vds-1017_Presentation.mp4?token=tycxDYPp4XFrZxDAnrAyDhkPsi2lBk8ZxtU2DnOfMdg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1017/s-vds-1017_Presentation.vtt?token=CFd6of6URqRobhxFzYdTPpBkUVqvaezRRUVvbBi3E4c&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Will Epperson"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Quick dashboarding presents a novel specification for dashboard authoring, comprised of sections of metrics combined with dimensions.","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","session_id":"ae3","slot_id":"s-vds-1017","time_end":"2023-10-23T06:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-23T03:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-23T03:00:00Z","title":"A Declarative Specification for Authoring Metrics Dashboards","uid":"s-vds-1017","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"Q9jktmeRYJQ","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/Q9jktmeRYJQ"},{"abstract":"Causal language models have emerged as the leading technology for automating text generation tasks. Although these models tend to produce outputs that resemble human writing, they still suffer from quality issues (e.g., social biases). Researchers typically use automatic analysis methods to evaluate the model limitations, such as statistics on stereotypical words. Since different types of issues are embedded in the model parameters, the development of automated methods that capture all relevant aspects remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a visual analytics approach that supports the exploratory analysis of text sequences generated by causal language models. Our approach enables users to specify starting prompts and effectively groups the resulting text sequences. To this end, we leverage a unified, ontology-driven embedding space, serving as a shared foundation for the thematic concepts present in the generated text sequences. Visual summaries provide insights into various levels of granularity within the generated data. Among others, we propose a novel comparison visualization that slices the embedding space and represents the differences between two prompt outputs in a radial layout. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies, showcasing its potential to reveal model biases and other quality issues.","authors":["Rita Sevastjanova","Simon Vogelbacher","Andreas Spitz","Daniel Keim","Mennatallah El-Assady"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1018/s-vds-1018_Preview.mp4?token=9EC_VqnLPL9ofVgqM-2zweM4ImRteqbFXP92LdPhU9E&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1018/s-vds-1018_Preview.vtt?token=uwE4ZgazlQMFh_H8Xnbio5ViBqcCj2oisN3tFNjoa4s&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1018/s-vds-1018_Presentation.mp4?token=nlj7IRTIAUJkmfAx_B4pMZcvXkq6XBCeqRjtx8OrP2A&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/s-vds/s-vds-1018/s-vds-1018_Presentation.vtt?token=MViyr5XKJ75fBRkUaUiKjSqn7MJZjazpzUSUvOlWc0M&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Mennatallah El-Assady"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We introduce a novel visual analytics approach supporting exploratory analysis of automatically generated text sequences and their comparison.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to explore emotion-related factors. However, so far, this research area is still in its early stages and faces a set of challenges, such as the unclear definition of key concepts, the insufficient justification of why emotion is important in visualization design, and the lack of characterization of the design space of affective visualization design. To address these challenges, first, we conducted a literature review and identified three research lines that examined both emotion and data visualization. We clarified the differences between these research lines and kept 109 papers that studied or discussed how data visualization communicates and influences emotion. Then, we coded the 109 papers in terms of how they justified the legitimacy of considering emotion in visualization design (i.e., why emotion is important) and identified five argumentative perspectives. Based on these papers, we also identified 61 projects that practiced affective visualization design. We coded these design projects in three dimensions, including design fields (where), design tasks (what), and design methods (how), to explore the design space of affective visualization design.","authors":["Xingyu Lan","Yanqiu Wu","Nan Cao"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1009/v-full-1009_Preview.mp4?token=TQoD13Vo0XHcdym-oh4_RYw2E36BvLYHUIDCXj7tjAU&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1009/v-full-1009_Preview.vtt?token=RLrPi3rtJoA1wGjXw1BUUTZf0PFU1FINs7FDfDWZmlI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1009/v-full-1009_Presentation.mp4?token=OEwUdugcYoiG3ymrJ1I1pfuA1vxtRMw0sTMe2EAHsts&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1009/v-full-1009_Presentation.vtt?token=7JetXIhkbfwWRs8WaTTcX8jBmORmUTvf9zukG-QREYU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Xingyu Lan"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327385","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The image has 3 panels: (i)examples of affective visualization design projects; (ii)six identified genres of affective visualization design projects (interactive interface, video, static image/painting, installation, artifact, event), and (iii) the design space proposed by this work, showing WHERE to apply affective visualization design, WHAT design tasks it undertakes, and HOW to perform the design.","keywords":["Information Visualization;Affective Design;Visual Communication;User Experience;Storytelling"],"paper_award":"best","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1009","time_end":"2023-10-24T03:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-24T03:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-24T03:00:00Z","title":"Affective Visualization Design: Leveraging the Emotional Impact of Data","uid":"v-full-1009","youtube_ff_id":"Q7KBPKW85qc","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/Q7KBPKW85qc","youtube_prerecorded_id":"cPMVHC2cAWE","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/cPMVHC2cAWE"},{"abstract":"Voxel-based segmentation volumes often store a large number of labels and voxels, and the resulting amount of data can make storage, transfer, and interactive visualization difficult. We present a lossless compression technique which addresses these challenges. It processes individual small bricks of a segmentation volume and compactly encodes the labelled regions and their boundaries by an iterative refinement scheme. The result for each brick is a list of labels, and a sequence of operations to reconstruct the brick which is further compressed using rANS-entropy coding. As the relative frequencies of operations are very similar across bricks, the entropy coding can use global frequency tables for an entire data set which enables efficient and effective parallel (de)compression. Our technique achieves high throughput (up to gigabytes per second both for compression and decompression) and strong compression ratios of about 1% to 3% of the original data set size while being applicable to GPU-based rendering. We evaluate our method for various data sets from different fields and demonstrate GPU-based volume visualization with on-the-fly decompression, level-of-detail rendering (with optional on-demand streaming of detail coefficients to the GPU), and a caching strategy for decompressed bricks for further performance improvement.","authors":["Max Piochowiak","Carsten Dachsbacher"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1392/v-full-1392_Preview.mp4?token=HliOynftLK8vnxdHHFY06S7hCm6VwLYd7Pyi54D2s5A&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1392/v-full-1392_Preview.vtt?token=SXJ7lIXouz05wqACHL4pmw0NPj7F1fuLs0L-C6ZQh44&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1392/v-full-1392_Presentation.mp4?token=r-_tF1H1OEn3DeL47eq9G9jWPvNwkgfgk9VLkvTMgpE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1392/v-full-1392_Presentation.vtt?token=rpNnr_Y8ThdhDTYCvCjULlLjBe8X6KC1ZmyXTSUtdLI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Max Piochowiak"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326573","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Our novel segmentation volume compression can be used to interactively render large data sets.

Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts: single quantile dotplot (1-Dotplot), dual quantile dotplots (2-Dotplot), dual histogram intervals (2-Interval), and Plinko quantile dotplot (Plinko), an animated design with a physical and probabilistic analogy. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022, to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We use Bayesian multilevel modeling and post-stratification to produce demographically-representative estimates of people\u2019s emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people\u2019s intentions to participate in elections. 2-Interval shows the strongest effects across all measures; 1-Dotplot increases trust the most after elections. Both visualizations create emotional and trust gaps between different partisan identities, especially when a Republican candidate is predicted to win. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization. This intriguing interplay between visualization types, partisanship, and trust exemplifies the fundamental challenge of disentangling visualization from its context, underscoring a need for deeper investigation into the real-world impacts of visualizations.

Authors can bend, compress, and expand temporal axes to emphasize or de-emphasize intervals based on their personal importance; they can also annotate the axes with text and figurative elements to convey contextual information. The results of two user studies show how people appropriate the concepts in TimeSplines to express their own conceptualization of time, while our curated gallery of images demonstrates the expressive potential of our approach.","authors":["Anna Offenwanger","Matthew Brehmer","Fanny Chevalier","Theophanis Tsandilas"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1439/v-full-1439_Preview.mp4?token=5jCN8tTei5Hy1ZJz08MfPjTjvUWG1cMENPJnx-uJnRQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1439/v-full-1439_Preview.vtt?token=f5xGSnvwTl2yuE1jOsW2yLRk0t9q4E57yf6TNMTl2iM&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1439/v-full-1439_Presentation.mp4?token=TuVxmXGx5SMkuEHAnr-ddW3pBW2G1TyTgfwNq1-2Tvc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1439/v-full-1439_Presentation.vtt?token=xJicl9Ny70y3vlE395xOiiKjxydE3XpCJ3NEh_VpXYk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Anna Offenwanger"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326520","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The TimeSplines interface.

The method is based on an interactive local reference frame estimation that minimizes the observed time derivative of the input flow field v(x, t). A locally optimal reference frame w(x, t) assists the user in the identification of physically observable vortex structures in Observed Line Integral Convolution (LIC) visualizations. The observed LIC visualizations are interactively computed and displayed in a user-steered vortex lens region, embedded in the context of a conventional LIC visualization outside the lens. The locally optimal reference frame is then used to detect observed critical points, where v = w, which are used to seed vortex core lines. Each vortex core line is computed as a solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) (see paper for equation), with an observed critical point as initial condition (w(t0), t0). During integration, we enforce a strict error bound on the difference between the extracted core line and the integration of a path line of the input vector field, i.e., a solution to the ODE (see paper for equation). We experimentally verify that this error depends on the step size of the core line integration. This ensures that our method extracts Lagrangian vortex core lines that are the simultaneous solution of both ODEs with a numerical error that is controllable by the integration step size. We show the usability of our method in the context of an interactive system using a lens metaphor, and evaluate the results in comparison to state-of-the-art vortex core line extraction methods.","authors":["Peter Rautek","Xingdi Zhang","Bernhard Woschizka","Thomas Theussl","Markus Hadwiger"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1226/v-full-1226_Preview.mp4?token=Oxnm0Jw0s1rJAGMfYnUYRDWGObW3zFIjW_MXgY1dFrM&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1226/v-full-1226_Preview.vtt?token=09fMfGj2AVNjWfHmy9vbo3PcniW3ZbuNwvEjR_n5h_o&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1226/v-full-1226_Presentation.mp4?token=IXNBWCxPesIXnITrlNCR_hVwTfgfwrZbSn0Bv_Ku8KI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1226/v-full-1226_Presentation.vtt?token=O402TSsJtesdT-Mt_zT8t8gw3Es0H0BsR_ScxO9S_5w&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Peter Rautek"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326915","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Fluid flow simulation visualized using line integral convolution and color coding of vorticity.

Design choices in scatterplots, such as graphical encodings or data aspects, can directly impact decision-making quality for low-level tasks like clustering. Hence, constructing frameworks that consider both the perceptions of the visual encodings and the task being performed enables optimizing visualizations to maximize efficacy. In this paper, we propose an automatic tool to optimize the design factors of scatterplots to reveal the most salient cluster structure. Our approach leverages the merge tree data structure to identify the clusters and optimize the choice of subsampling algorithm, sampling rate, marker size, and marker opacity used to generate a scatterplot image.

Most methods approach multivariate data from a singular perspective. Subspace analysis techniques, on the other hand. provide the user a set of subspaces which can be used to view the data from multiple perspectives. However, many subspace analysis methods produce a huge amount of subspaces, a number of which are usually redundant. The enormity of the number of subspaces can be overwhelming to analysts, making it difficult for them to find informative patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that constructs semantically consistent subspaces. These subspaces can then be expanded into more general subspaces by ways of conventional techniques. Our framework uses the labels/meta-data of a dataset to learn the semantic meanings and associations of the attributes. We employ a neural network to learn a semantic word embedding of the attributes and then divide this attribute space into semantically consistent subspaces.

There can be many stakeholders interested in the resulting analyses\u2014but widespread sharing of the data can cause harm to individuals, companies, and organizations. Practitioners are increasingly turning to differential privacy to enable public sharing of data with a guaranteed amount of privacy. Differential privacy algorithms do this by aggregating data statistics with noise, and this now-private data can be released visually with differentially private scatterplots. While the private visual output is affected by the algorithm choice, privacy level, bin number, data distribution, and user task, there is little guidance on how to choose and balance the effect of these parameters. To address this gap, we had experts examine 1,200 differentially private scatterplots created with a variety of parameter choices and tested their ability to see aggregate patterns in the private output (i.e. the visual utility of the chart). We synthesized these results to provide easy-to-use guidance for visualization practitioners releasing private data through scatterplots. Our findings also provide a ground truth for visual utility, which we use to benchmark automated utility metrics from a variety of fields. We demonstrate how multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM), the metric most strongly correlated with our study\u2019s utility results, can be used to optimize parameter selection.

However, even with the same scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual clustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous cluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the reliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic way to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster Ambiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality measure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that affect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference between clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that estimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts cluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise separability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS outperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human annotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing and benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS.

This approach is based on the assumption that the classes stay as clear clusters in the original high-dimensional space. However, in reality, this assumption can be violated; a single class can be fragmented into multiple separated clusters, and multiple classes can be merged into a single cluster. We thus cannot always assure the credibility of the evaluation using class labels. In this paper, we introduce two novel quality measures\u2014Label-Trustworthiness and Label-Continuity (Label-T&C)\u2014advancing the process of DR evaluation based on class labels. Instead of assuming that classes are well-clustered in the original space, Label-T&C work by (1) estimating the extent to which classes form clusters in the original and embedded spaces and (2) evaluating the difference between the two. A quantitative evaluation showed that Label-T&C outperform widely used DR evaluation measures (e.g., Trustworthiness and Continuity, Kullback-Leibler divergence) in terms of the accuracy in assessing how well DR embeddings preserve the cluster structure, and are also scalable. Moreover, we present case studies demonstrating that Label-T&C can be successfully used for revealing the intrinsic characteristics of DR techniques and their hyperparameters.","authors":["Hyeon Jeon","Yun-Hsin Kuo","Michael Aupetit","Kwan-Liu Ma","Jinwook Seo"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1025/v-full-1025_Preview.mp4?token=uzvMPLP9cnMQhwBsdodG2F4opdUgoObDYWX3cxETcig&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1025/v-full-1025_Preview.vtt?token=oBGtA9nveuIrJmnbHRF5CWzy37RlOrh04Z6DqpvcqYk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1025/v-full-1025_Presentation.mp4?token=8T2fvxnUCt9UrgRbCb8tLDtkLCbliPmgu9j_YJ0QgK0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1025/v-full-1025_Presentation.vtt?token=XebHQU3EuIfB2a9-KVtvK1SRZ3S8AHTBO1fa9dVgaAE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Hyeon Jeon"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327187","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Guidelines to infer the Cluster-Label Matching (CLM) of the high-dimensional data based on the CLM of the embedded data (left column) and the scores given by Label-T (Trustworthiness) and Label-C (Continuity) (first row)","keywords":["Dimensionality Reduction, Reliability, Clustering, Clustering Validation Measures, Dimensionality Reduction Evaluation"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full2","slot_id":"v-full-1025","time_end":"2023-10-25T23:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T22:48:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T22:48:00Z","title":"Classes are not Clusters: Improving Label-based Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction","uid":"v-full-1025","youtube_ff_id":"2z0zTS7lSMo","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/2z0zTS7lSMo","youtube_prerecorded_id":"_lIlinnyHkA","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/_lIlinnyHkA"},{"abstract":"In 2D visualizations, visibility of every datum's representation is crucial to ease the completion of visual tasks. Such a guarantee is barely respected in complex visualizations, mainly because of overdraws between datum representations that hide parts of the information (e.g., outliers). The literature proposes various Layout Adjustment algorithms to improve the readability of visualizations that suffer from this issue. Manipulating the data in high-dimensional, geometric or visual space; they rely on different strategies with their own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, most of these algorithms are computationally expensive as they search for an exact solution in the geometric space and do not scale well to large datasets. This article proposes GIST, a layout adjustment algorithm that aims at optimizing three criteria: (i) node visibility guarantee (at least 1 pixel), (ii) node size maximization, and (iii) the original layout preservation. This is achieved by combining a search for the maximum node size that enables to draw all the data points without overlaps, with a limited budget of movements (i.e., limiting the distortions of the original layout). The method's basis relies on the idea that it is not necessary for two data representations to be strictly not overlapping in order to guarantee their visibility in visual space.  Our algorithm therefore uses a tolerance in the geometric space to determine the overlaps between pairs of data.  The tolerance is optimized such that the approximation computed in the geometric space can lead to visualization without noticeable overdraw after the data rendering rasterization. In addition, such an approximation helps to ease the algorithm's convergence as it reduces the number of constraints to resolve, enabling it to handle large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its results to those of state-of-the-art methods on several large datasets.","authors":["Loann Giovannangeli","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lalanne","Romain Giot","Romain Bourqui"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1473/v-full-1473_Preview.mp4?token=DVJQTgm5Reh6kbbPvpfjEeqDCTyZ3YpfbADrPUYAJ8k&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1473/v-full-1473_Preview.vtt?token=m_zwyVBJgFsWOmiyq-UKM6FtLXFi7M-3vDXDvjtu2NA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1473/v-full-1473_Presentation.mp4?token=xADn38Hd08YLnmiedM3m3sp4EF8spLG-Cu9zmDnbnxI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1473/v-full-1473_Presentation.vtt?token=ggXl38NLkZIoMUyPXeb_RZoNXGKl9fNzrGX8xZAG3oU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Loann Giovannangeli"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326596","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"GIST is a Layout Adjustment method to improve data visibility in scatter plots where their visual representations overlap.

However, the empirical evidence behind this argument has been mixed and, at times, even contradictory. In practice, rainbow colormaps are widely used, raising questions about the true utility or dangers of such designs. We study how color categorization impacts the interpretation of scalar fields. We first introduce an approach to detect latent categories in colormaps. We hypothesize that the appearance of color categories in scalar visualizations can be beneficial in that they enhance the perception of certain features, although at the cost of rendering other features less noticeable. In three crowdsourced experiments, we show that observers are more likely to discriminate global, distributional features when viewing colorful scales that induce categorization (e.g., rainbow or diverging schemes). Conversely, when seeing the same data through a less colorful representation, observers are more likely to report localized features defined by small variations in the data. Participants showed awareness of these different affordances, and exhibited bias for exploiting the more discriminating colormap, given a particular feature type. Our results demonstrate costs and benefits for rainbows (and similarly colorful schemes), suggesting that their complementary utility for analyzing scalar data should not be dismissed. In addition to explaining potentially valid uses of rainbow, our study provides actionable guidelines, including on when such designs can be more harmful than useful.

Existing visualizations often lack an underlying navigable structure, fail to engage necessary input modalities, and rely heavily on visual-only rendering practices. These limitations exclude people with disabilities, especially users of assistive technologies. To address these challenges, we present Data Navigator: a system built on a dynamic graph structure, enabling developers to construct navigable lists, trees, graphs, and flows as well as spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic relations.

However, designing a good color palette for a chart is a challenging task for novice users who lack related design expertise. For example, they often find it difficult to articulate their abstract intentions and translate these intentions into effective editing actions to achieve a desired outcome. In this work, we present NL2Color, a tool that allows novice users to modify chart color palettes using natural language expressions of their desired outcomes. We first collected and categorized a dataset of 131 triplets, each consisting of an original color palette of a chart, an editing intent, and a new color palette designed by human experts according to the intent. Our tool employs a large language model (LLM) to substitute the colors in original palettes and produce new color palettes by selecting some of the triplets as few-shot prompts. To evaluate our tool, we conducted a comprehensive two-stage evaluation, including a crowd-sourcing study (N=71) and a within-subjects user study (N=12). The results indicate that the quality of the color palettes revised by NL2Color has no significantly large difference from those designed by human experts. The participants who used NL2Color obtained revised color palettes to their satisfaction in a shorter period and with less effort.","authors":["Chuhan Shi","Weiwei Cui","Chengzhong Liu","Chengbo Zheng","Haidong Zhang","Qiong Luo","Xiaojuan Ma"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1830/v-full-1830_Preview.mp4?token=RzEicBBBTJEM_ToUAiBQk94mBgmFGS5I5Vohtnz41gA&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1830/v-full-1830_Preview.vtt?token=leC8NJW8VtZUCwhDg-EBsYPQHYIZC0qAkeKa5BhGTY8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1830/v-full-1830_Presentation.mp4?token=_0XtU5fRdklTMPJpB_qq5IoLfbcxdmPAP-VfuP-er-g&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1830/v-full-1830_Presentation.vtt?token=8llEkMV0ZNoVU18bUIVLXraiStZlE_F1wABaGAG5UsQ&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Chuhan Shi"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326522","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Examples of color palette refinement by NL2Color.

However, these traditional density plots are often perceived ambiguously, which obstructs the user's identification of underlying trends in complex datasets. Thus, we propose a novel image space coloring method for line-based density plots that enhances their interpretability. Our method employs color not only to visually communicate data density but also to highlight similar regions in the plot, allowing users to identify and distinguish trends easily. We achieve this by performing hierarchical clustering based on the lines passing through each region and mapping the identified clusters to the hue circle using circular MDS. Additionally, we propose a heuristic approach to assign each line to the most probable cluster, enabling users to analyze density and individual lines. We motivate our method by conducting a small-scale user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method using synthetic and real-world datasets, and providing an interactive online tool for generating colored line-based density plots.","authors":["Yumeng Xue","Patrick Paetzold","Rebecca Kehlbeck","Bin Chen","Kin Chung Kwan","Yunhai Wang","Oliver Deussen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1152/v-full-1152_Preview.mp4?token=gT0ikopMWglw07IlQ9RSsffOUdXTqy91n6mN8K6BYR0&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1152/v-full-1152_Preview.vtt?token=x4tm-xpNrxL25iYX8zP7HmGfL5wScXBRHc5WVvL6l1c&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1152/v-full-1152_Presentation.mp4?token=l1b_cl9zAUSp1NKFxHd2hzllSPs2I27Rslxeg_Va_GY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1152/v-full-1152_Presentation.vtt?token=7_bYHfCveOJYeeVMLWCGX5zYPe5XYfXYPrK_h2SHjac&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Yumeng Xue"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327149","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Trajectories of taxi rides in Beijing: (a) A line-based visualization of the trajectories is cluttered and convoluted; (b) Using a density plot eliminates clutter, but the continuation of the trends is ambiguous, e.g., it looks like taxis follow the prominent, circular route around the city center; (c) Pixel-based colorization reveals clusters, we see that taxis mostly stay in one part of the city.","keywords":["Trajectory data, times series, density-based visualization, clustering, coloring"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full3","slot_id":"v-full-1152","time_end":"2023-10-25T23:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T22:48:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T22:48:00Z","title":"Reducing Ambiguity in Line-based Density Plots by Image-space Colorization","uid":"v-full-1152","youtube_ff_id":"-9BPVyeWbbs","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/-9BPVyeWbbs","youtube_prerecorded_id":"-B164EgzQKs","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/-B164EgzQKs"},{"abstract":"Tactile graphics are one of the best ways for a blind person to perceive a chart using touch, but their fabrication is often costly, time-consuming, and does not lend itself to dynamic exploration. Refreshable haptic displays tend to be expensive and thus unavailable to most blind individuals. We propose TactualPlot, an approach to sensory substitution where touch interaction yields auditory (sonified) feedback. The technique relies on embodied cognition for spatial awareness\u2014i.e., individuals can perceive 2D touch locations of their fingers with reference to other 2D locations such as the relative locations of other fingers or chart characteristics that are visualized on touchscreens. Combining touch and sound in this way yields a scalable data exploration method for scatterplots where the data density under the user\u2019s fingertips is sampled. The sample regions can optionally be scaled based on how quickly the user moves their hand. Our development of TactualPlot was informed by formative design sessions with a blind collaborator, whose practice while using tactile scatterplots caused us to expand the technique for multiple fingers. We present results from an evaluation comparing our TactualPlot interaction technique to tactile graphics printed on swell touch paper.","authors":["Pramod Chundury","Yasmin Reyazuddin","J.

However, creating effective and elegant dashboards is challenging since it requires careful and logical arrangement and coordination of multiple visualizations. To solve the problem, we propose a data-driven approach for mining design rules from dashboards and automating dashboard organization. Specifically, we focus on two prominent aspects of the organization: arrangement, which describes the position, size, and layout of each view in the display space; and coordination, which indicates the interaction between pairwise views. We build a new dataset containing 854 dashboards crawled online, and develop feature engineering methods for describing the single views and view-wise relationships in terms of data, encoding, layout, and interactions. Further, we identify design rules among those features and develop a recommender for dashboard design. We demonstrate the usefulness of DMiner through an expert study and a user study. The expert study shows that our extracted design rules are reasonable and conform to the design practice of experts. Moreover, a comparative user study shows that our recommender could help automate dashboard organization and reach human-level performance.

In this paper, we opted to revisit the composite visualizations in IEEE VIS publications and answered what and how visualizations of different types are composed together. To achieve this, we first constructed a corpus of composite visualizations from the publications and analyzed common practices, such as the pattern distributions and co-occurrence of visualization types.

However, most existing MV visualizations are designed for the desktop, which can be unsuitable for the continuously evolving displays of varying screen sizes. In this paper, we present a two-stage adaptation framework that supports the automated retargeting and semi-automated tailoring of a desktop MV visualization for rendering on devices with displays of varying sizes. First, we cast layout retargeting as an optimization problem and propose a simulated annealing technique that can automatically preserve the layout of multiple views. Second, we enable fine-tuning for the visual appearance of each view, using a rule-based auto configuration method complemented with an interactive interface for chart-oriented encoding adjustment. To demonstrate the feasibility and expressivity of our proposed approach, we present a gallery of MV visualizations that have been adapted from the desktop to small displays. We also report the result of a user study comparing visualizations generated using our approach with those by existing methods. The outcome indicates that the participants generally prefer visualizations generated using our approach and find them to be easier to use.","authors":["Wei Zeng","Xi Chen","Yihan Hou","Lingdan Shao","Zhe Chu","Remco Chang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10029921/v-tvcg-10029921_Preview.mp4?token=dv0ZGjOVqkGrLL2Vil2BdTfo1zKEk2mVLQBmTHCfieI&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10029921/v-tvcg-10029921_Preview.vtt?token=G85_Gyn_2XucnVXO5Tp3-0NjbHszEMymrfEZX_4VjgE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10029921/v-tvcg-10029921_Presentation.mp4?token=gj6ZL0ne6rfPFSaJySrYtJDZIFfs9y4Qw8EeIQLHXLs&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10029921/v-tvcg-10029921_Presentation.vtt?token=5uQ0To-tnkL9jzOeOIxESk9Mh62J_dwJHA22FXHo_FQ&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Wei Zeng"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3240356","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10029921","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This work considers the design space of a MV visualization with regards to visualization space, display property, and interaction.","keywords":["Layout adaptation;mobile devices;multiple-view visualization;responsive design"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full4","slot_id":"v-tvcg-10029921","time_end":"2023-10-25T03:36:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T03:24:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T03:24:00Z","title":"Semi-Automatic Layout Adaptation for Responsive Multiple-View Visualization Design","uid":"v-tvcg-10029921","youtube_ff_id":"ajN1aMBt2ZA","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/ajN1aMBt2ZA","youtube_prerecorded_id":"CVM5BKn5sgw","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/CVM5BKn5sgw"},{"abstract":"In the face of complex decisions, people often engage in a three-stage process that spans from (1) exploring and analyzing pertinent information (intelligence); (2) generating and exploring alternative options (design); and ultimately culminating in (3) selecting the optimal decision by evaluating discerning criteria (choice). We can fairly assume that all good visualizations aid in the \u201cintelligence\u201d stage by enabling data exploration and analysis. Yet, to what degree and how do visualization systems currently support the other decision making stages, namely \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d? To further explore this question, we conducted a comprehensive review of decision-focused visualization tools by examining publications in major visualization journals and conferences, including VIS, EuroVis, and CHI, spanning all available years. We employed a deductive coding method and in-depth analysis to assess whether and how visualization tools support design and choice. Specifically, we examined each visualization tool by (i) its degree of visibility for displaying decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences, and (ii) its degree of flexibility for offering means to manipulate the decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences with interactions such as adding, modifying, changing mapping, and filtering. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges that decision-focused visualization tools face in realizing their full potential to support all stages of the decision making process. It reveals a surprising scarcity of tools that support all stages, and while most tools excel in offering visibility for decision criteria and alternatives, the degree of flexibility to manipulate these elements is often limited, and the lack of tools that accommodate decision preferences and their elicitation is notable. Based on our findings, to better support the choice stage, future research could explore enhancing flexibility levels and variety, exploring novel visualization paradigms, increasing algorithmic support, and ensuring that this automation is user-controlled via the enhanced flexibility levels.

Existing dashboard design guidelines, however, are often unable to account for this expanded scope as they largely focus on best practices for visual design. In contrast, we frame dashboard design as facilitating an analytical conversation: a cooperative, interactive experience where a user may interact with, reason about, or freely query the underlying data. By drawing on established principles of conversational flow and communication, we define the concept of a cooperative dashboard as one that enables a fruitful and productive analytical conversation, and derive a set of 39 dashboard design heuristics to support effective analytical conversations. To assess the utility of this framing, we asked 52 computer science and engineering graduate students to apply our heuristics to critique and design dashboards as part of an ungraded, opt-in homework assignment. Feedback from participants demonstrates that our heuristics surface new reasons dashboards may fail, and encourage a more fluid, supportive, and responsive style of dashboard design. Our approach suggests several compelling directions for future work, including dashboard authoring tools that better anticipate conversational turn-taking, repair, and refinement and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows.","authors":["Vidya Setlur","Michael Correll","Arvind Satyanarayan","Melanie Tory"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1122/v-full-1122_Preview.mp4?token=KyrgyGh9FePgxDfQUJn_m04IMngHrvSeSXShxHCwGOg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1122/v-full-1122_Preview.vtt?token=8FbFu3NcZDUKf-1BovZTWMoFvICeg31QO72vZD2K-dE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1122/v-full-1122_Presentation.mp4?token=Q3m426YrG4_yxnfIEF5pnQBkMTgCHorFXHuPbjGrTzI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1122/v-full-1122_Presentation.vtt?token=mgGxJJEVh_g_aSF_hlxz5JrYQqW8avGuSQ6aEU5dDdU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Vidya Setlur"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327158","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Successes and failures of cooperative dashboard design throughout the five stages of an analytical conversation: initiation, grounding, turn taking, repair & refinement, and close.","keywords":["Gricean maxims, interactive visualization, conversation initiation, grounding, turn-taking, repair and refinement."],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full4","slot_id":"v-full-1122","time_end":"2023-10-25T04:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T03:48:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T03:48:00Z","title":"Heuristics for Supporting Cooperative Dashboard Design","uid":"v-full-1122","youtube_ff_id":"ESoh9DNeFgs","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/ESoh9DNeFgs","youtube_prerecorded_id":"zDR8CbsQznM","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/zDR8CbsQznM"},{"abstract":"Many long-established, traditional manufacturing businesses are becoming more digital and data-driven to improve their production. These companies are embracing visual analytics in these transitions through their adoption of commercial dashboarding systems. Although a number of studies have looked at the technical challenges of adopting these systems, very few have focused on the socio-technical issues that arise. In this paper, we report on the results of an interview study with 17 participants working in a range of roles at a long-established, traditional manufacturing company as they adopted Microsoft Power BI. The results highlight a number of socio-technical challenges the employees faced, including difficulties in training, using and creating dashboards, and transitioning to a modern digital company. Based on these results, we propose a number of opportunities for both companies and visualization researchers to improve these difficult transitions, as well as opportunities for rethinking how we design dashboarding systems for real-world use.","authors":["Conny Walchshofer","Vaishali Dhanoa","Marc Streit","Miriah Meyer"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1642/v-full-1642_Preview.mp4?token=cAa46c8L67w9N1n0ziTijH6dKALtwEICPZPf_t3WxxI&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1642/v-full-1642_Preview.vtt?token=deSdxKxOcFQdD02c_U_SPKtRJhqMSwoeNq9d0WpbaKo&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1642/v-full-1642_Presentation.mp4?token=N4hjX94SqIaVsPslIsudp0tJZ7MOyoayi211k6tNsmA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1642/v-full-1642_Presentation.vtt?token=Ab8L7ZaNLYE1NZQjyAx081FtCaKe-OOfBgTZ4wT_ku8&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Conny Walchshofer"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326525","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"A summary of our 14 socio-technical observations and three opportunities from an interview study conducted at a large, conventional company as they transitioned to use Power BI.","keywords":["Interview study, socio-technical challenges, visual analytics"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full4","slot_id":"v-full-1642","time_end":"2023-10-25T04:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T04:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T04:00:00Z","title":"Transitioning to a Commercial Dashboarding System: Socio-technical Observations and Opportunities","uid":"v-full-1642","youtube_ff_id":"zt5TCRnhpko","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/zt5TCRnhpko","youtube_prerecorded_id":"-1ydaDEiVg0","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/-1ydaDEiVg0"}],"time_start":"2023-10-25T03:00:00Z","title":"Dashboards & Multiple Views","track":"oneohthree","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Niklas Elmqvist"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"106","discord_channel_id":"1161741373410644119","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741373410644119","event_prefix":"v-full","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/jKpJ4xBRVRQ","session_id":"full5","session_image":"full5.png","time_end":"2023-10-25T06:00:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"As communications are increasingly taking place virtually, the ability to present well online is becoming an indispensable skill. Online speakers are facing unique challenges in engaging with remote audiences. However, there has been a lack of evidence-based  analytical systems for people to comprehensively evaluate online speeches and further discover possibilities for improvement. This paper introduces SpeechMirror, a visual analytics system facilitating reflection on a speech based on insights from a collection of online speeches. The system estimates the impact of different speech techniques on effectiveness and applies them to a speech to give users awareness of the performance of speech techniques. A similarity recommendation approach based on speech factors or script content supports guided exploration to expand knowledge of presentation evidence and accelerate the discovery of speech delivery possibilities. SpeechMirror provides intuitive visualizations and interactions for users to understand speech factors. Among them, SpeechTwin, a novel multimodal visual summary of speech, supports rapid understanding of critical speech factors and comparison of different speech samples, and SpeechPlayer augments the speech video by integrating visualization of the speaker\u2019s body language with interaction, for focused analysis. The system utilizes visualizations suited to the distinct nature of different speech factors for user comprehension. The proposed system and visualization techniques were evaluated with domain experts and amateurs, demonstrating usability for users with low visualization literacy and its efficacy in assisting users to develop insights for potential improvement.","authors":["Zeyuan Huang","Qiang He","Kevin Maher","Xiaoming Deng","Yu-Kun Lai","Cuixia Ma","Shengfeng Qin","Yong-Jin Liu","Hongan Wang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1368/v-full-1368_Preview.mp4?token=qhtFrLDc3R87CMjv3MAt_5G7-s6ML62GF44-ang4tOg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1368/v-full-1368_Preview.vtt?token=JV2uXuRbOLJ4IBTSiQr-jX_NduGpEpGsKKUlIO9cpS8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1368/v-full-1368_Presentation.mp4?token=G_-XA5H8W8VMPRA5aQ71-x9oicI6g3puxSLdGzsvtBI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1368/v-full-1368_Presentation.vtt?token=FuzbQwc8bi9tPT3KGXfX6hX6Gdzu5NP382RnGMJBHR8&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Zeyuan Huang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326932","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Our SpeechMirror system facilitates reflection on a speech based on insights from a collection of online speeches.","keywords":["Visual Analytics, Multimodal Analysis, Public Speaking, Online Presentation"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full5","slot_id":"v-full-1368","time_end":"2023-10-25T04:57:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T04:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T04:45:00Z","title":"SpeechMirror: A Multimodal Visual Analytics System for Personalized Reflection of Online Public Speaking Effectiveness","uid":"v-full-1368","youtube_ff_id":"8HGPaautdlk","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/8HGPaautdlk","youtube_prerecorded_id":"80PUu8Ll7Q8","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/80PUu8Ll7Q8"},{"abstract":"Manually grading D3 data visualizations is a challenging endeavor, and is especially difficult for large classes with hundreds of students.

However, due to the lack of reliable self-reported responses, service providers are troubled by the inadequate estimation of customer services and the tedious investigation into multimodal video recordings. We introduce Anchorage , a visual analytics system to evaluate customer satisfaction by summarizing multimodal behavioral features in customer service videos and revealing abnormal operations in the service process. We leverage the semantically meaningful operations to introduce structured event understanding into videos which help service providers quickly navigate to events of their interest. Anchorage supports a comprehensive evaluation of customer satisfaction from the service and operation levels and efficient analysis of customer behavioral dynamics via multifaceted visualization views. We extensively evaluate Anchorage through a case study and a carefully-designed user study. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in assessing customer satisfaction using customer service videos. We found that introducing event contexts in assessing customer satisfaction can enhance its performance without compromising annotation precision.

Consequently, it is vital to understand the evolution of this ability and devise targeted interventions to enhance it, requiring concise and repeatable assessments of visualization literacy for individuals. However, current assessments, such as the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT), are time-consuming due to their fixed, lengthy format. To address this limitation, we develop two streamlined computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for visualization literacy, A-VLAT and A-CALVI, which measure the same set of skills as their original versions in half the number of questions. Specifically, we (1) employ item response theory (IRT) and non-psychometric constraints to construct adaptive versions of the assessments, (2) finalize the configurations of adaptation through simulation, (3) refine the composition of test items of A-CALVI via a qualitative study, and (4) demonstrate the test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.98 and 0.98) and convergent validity (correlation: 0.81 and 0.66) of both CATs via four online studies. We discuss practical recommendations for using our CATs and opportunities for further customization to leverage the full potential of adaptive assessments.

During the questionnaire analysis, classical statistical methods (e.g., Differences-in-Differences) have been widely exploited to evaluate causality between questions. However, due to the huge search space and complex causal structure in data, causal reasoning is still extremely challenging and time-consuming, and often conducted in a trial-and-error manner. On the other hand, existing visual methods of causal reasoning face the challenge of bringing scalability and expert knowledge together and can hardly be used in the questionnaire scenario. In this work, we present a systematic solution to help analysts effectively and efficiently explore questionnaire data and derive causality. Based on the association mining algorithm, we dig question combinations with potential inner causality and help analysts interactively explore the causal sub-graph of each question combination. Furthermore, leveraging the requirements collected from the experts, we built a visualization tool and conducted a comparative study with the state-of-the-art system to show the usability and efficiency of our system.","authors":["Renzhong Li","Weiwei Cui","Tianqi Song","Xiao Xie","Rui Ding","Yun Wang","Haidong Zhang","Hong Zhou","Yingcai Wu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1519/v-full-1519_Preview.mp4?token=fb6Qwezus9M3IfFprqyH9Frue0qxuykTTh7xmILs_ZQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1519/v-full-1519_Preview.vtt?token=Q0Y0vjQivualQLoob_ktJ7WtjAnIjNm86BNU2g00UgA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1519/v-full-1519_Presentation.mp4?token=5UR28PHZehyboYW0bcQ59r27HWGhi1vd2n1KD6YWOYI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1519/v-full-1519_Presentation.vtt?token=t2grVF7bzPHuRtGqe6OXcdVVC0vubKLdACq6kGLuphE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Renzhong Li"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327376","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The interface of QE: (A) The question list view displays all questions.

As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper\u2014educators and researchers in data visualization\u2014identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world: viseducationchallenges.github.io","authors":["Benjamin Bach","Mandy Keck","Fateme Rajabiyazdi","Tatiana Losev","Isabel Meirelles","Jason Dykes","Robert S.

Due to the rich, detailed diagnostic data captured by distributed tracing tools, effectively presenting this data is important. However, use of visualisation to enable perceptual sensemaking of this complex data in today\u2019s distributed tracing tools has received relatively little attention. Consequently, operators struggle to make effective use of existing tools. In this paper we present the first characterisation of distributed tracing visualisation through a qualitative interview study with six practitioners from two large internet companies. Across two rounds of 1-on-1 interviews we use grounded theory coding to establish users, extract concrete use cases and identify shortcomings of existing distributed tracing tools. We derive guidelines for development of future distributed tracing tools and expose several open research problems that have wide reaching implications for visualisation research and other domain applications.","authors":["Thomas Davidson","Emily Wall","Jonathan Mace"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10034850/v-tvcg-10034850_Preview.mp4?token=NPJjKOjFiOYcUOodbVBAUWLy4ouTG_yHK-5u5VmPcyQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10034850/v-tvcg-10034850_Preview.vtt?token=Dz5HhnlZQzkrCXNMffxwf8sNN74q317RqbY61Uo1fyU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10034850/v-tvcg-10034850_Presentation.mp4?token=mWw1UPlT31QiX9MT_yzRFC2tk3_n5XdT6NY599GGB10&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10034850/v-tvcg-10034850_Presentation.vtt?token=8PRnguSJ6hUgQW5zL5NhBGSycXF_6Ne8fO-Gnd5PBl4&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Thomas Davidson"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3241596","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10034850","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"A diagram depicting distributed systems and existing analytical solutions,  the work we carried out in this project - a qualitative interview study  and grounded theory coding, and the outputs of the project: a  characterisation of distributed tracing, 5 key challenges, and 8 design  guidelines","keywords":["Visualisation;Distributed Tracing;Systems"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full6","slot_id":"v-tvcg-10034850","time_end":"2023-10-25T23:57:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T23:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T23:45:00Z","title":"A Qualitative Interview Study of Distributed Tracing Visualisation: A Characterisation of Challenges and Opportunities in Visualisation Research","uid":"v-tvcg-10034850","youtube_ff_id":"pwhzN-8o5mo","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/pwhzN-8o5mo","youtube_prerecorded_id":"VswMm2SEvWs","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/VswMm2SEvWs"},{"abstract":"We present experimental results to explore a form of bivariate glyphs for representing large-magnitude-range vectors. The glyphs meet two conditions: (1) two visual dimensions are separable; and (2) one of the two visual dimensions uses a categorical representation (e.g., a categorical colormap). We evaluate how much these two conditions determine the bivariate glyphs\u2019 effectiveness. The first experiment asks participants to perform three local tasks requiring reading no more than two glyphs. The second experiment scales up the search space in global tasks when participants must look at the entire scene of hundreds of vector glyphs to get an answer. Our results support that the first condition is necessary for local tasks when a few items are compared. But it is not enough for understanding a large amount of data. The second condition is necessary for perceiving global structures of examining very complex datasets. Participants\u2019 comments reveal that the categorical features in the bivariate glyphs trigger emergent optimal viewers\u2019 behaviors.

However, to achieve the primary benefits of automating this part of decision-making, people must be able to trust the machine learning model's outputs. In order to enhance people's trust and promote appropriate reliance on the model, visualization techniques such as interactive model steering, performance analysis, model comparison, and uncertainty visualization have been proposed. In this study, we tested the effects of two uncertainty visualization techniques in a college admissions forecasting task, under two task difficulty levels, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Results show that (1) people's reliance on the model depends on the task difficulty and level of machine uncertainty and (2) ordinal forms of expressing model uncertainty are more likely to calibrate model usage behavior. These outcomes emphasize that reliance on decision support tools can depend on the cognitive accessibility of the visualization technique and perceptions of model performance and task difficulty.","authors":["Jieqiong Zhao","Yixuan Wang","Michelle V.

And how do different visualization techniques impact this capability? This paper shares the results of a crowdsourced experiment that tested the ability of respondents to fit normal curves to four different data distribution visualizations: bar histograms, dotplot histograms, strip plots, and boxplots. We find that the crowd can estimate the center (mean) of a distribution with some success and little bias. We also find that people generally overestimate the standard deviation---which we dub the \"umbrella effect\" because people tend to want to cover the whole distribution using the curve, as if sheltering it from the heavens above---and that strip plots yield the best accuracy.","authors":["Eric Newburger","Michael Correll","Niklas Elmqvist"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9905944/v-tvcg-9905944_Preview.mp4?token=-z_RELQlxvR12eNFYYzyspCwjDHn3UxoRQ0ZaVNaduE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9905944/v-tvcg-9905944_Preview.vtt?token=PHgSl7fc_fcIIczy_t8b_UrPQ5DyOhx59e2rl4ewrt0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9905944/v-tvcg-9905944_Presentation.mp4?token=GNXcpxys7Pcn_vl1jzCfVeVPWptTImhTHfAukuNQJns&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9905944/v-tvcg-9905944_Presentation.vtt?token=MzNf0XnXHByLZjTgHkvmjXfHTgLeNAB6lf7l3tgMcWI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Eric Newburger"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3210763","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9905944","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Can people fit a normal curve to a data distribution through visual interactions alone?

We tackle this question by introducing and validating a practical evaluation methodology for guidance in visual analytics. We identify eight quality criteria to be fulfilled and collect expert feedback on their validity. To facilitate actual evaluation studies, we derive two sets of heuristics. The first set targets heuristic evaluations conducted by expert evaluators. The second set facilitates end-user studies where participants actually use a guidance-enhanced system. By following such a dual approach, the different quality criteria of guidance can be examined from two different perspectives, enhancing the overall value of evaluation studies. To test the practical utility of our methodology, we employ it in two studies to gain insight into the quality of two guidance-enhanced visual analytics solutions, one being a work-in-progress research prototype, and the other being a publicly available visualization recommender system. Based on these two evaluations, we derive good practices for conducting evaluations of guidance in visual analytics and identify pitfalls to be avoided during such studies.","authors":["Davide Ceneda","Christopher Collins","Mennatallah El-Assady","Silvia Miksch","Christian Tominski","Alessio Arleo"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1048/v-full-1048_Preview.mp4?token=0iWyC9kDmmgLdp9NU5W847EokCofbxHNAXn4w8MqkxY&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1048/v-full-1048_Preview.vtt?token=XeYc60eMdGSElamHmzAORefySAx12CH1tuJsZIAXcVE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1048/v-full-1048_Presentation.mp4?token=GpLtc2-oQbm3a9Nd_cV6SomRz3XPEkVUsoUEYHU0FXI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1048/v-full-1048_Presentation.vtt?token=v3CF3k5sJ74LHSvGvNml7HlTjTPIwh9bDfOtoe830SI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Alessio Arleo"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327152","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We introduce and validate a practical evaluation methodology for guidance in visual analytics.

Instead, tackling fairness must be inclusive and involve domain experts with specialized tools and workflows. Thus, domain-specific visualizations are needed for algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, while much work on AI fairness has focused on predictive decisions, less has been done for fair allocation and planning, which require human expertise and iterative design to integrate myriad constraints. We propose the Intelligible Fair Allocation (IF-Alloc) Framework that leverages explanations of causal attribution (Why), contrastive (Why Not) and counterfactual reasoning (What If, How To) to aid domain experts to assess and alleviate unfairness in allocation problems. We apply the framework to fair urban planning for designing cities that provide equal access to amenities and benefits for diverse resident types. Specifically, we propose an interactive visual tool, Intelligible Fair City Planner (IF-City), to help urban planners to perceive inequality across groups, identify and attribute sources of inequality, and mitigate inequality with automatic allocation simulations and constraint-satisfying recommendations (IF-Plan). We demonstrate and evaluate the usage and usefulness of IF-City on a real neighborhood in New York City, US, with practicing urban planners from multiple countries, and discuss generalizing our findings, application, and framework to other use cases and applications of fair allocation.","authors":["Yan Lyu","Hangxin Lu","Min Kyung Lee","Gerhard Schmitt","Brian Y.

A common problem faced when visualizing this type of data is how to provide an overview that helps users navigate efficiently. Traditional approaches use coordinated views or 3D metaphors like the Space-time cube to tackle this problem. However, they suffer from overplotting and often lack spatial context, hindering data exploration. More recent techniques, such as MotionRugs, propose compact temporal summaries based on 1D projection. While powerful, these techniques do not support the situation for which the spatial extent of the objects and their intersections is relevant, such as the analysis of surveillance videos or tracking weather storms. In this paper, we propose MoReVis, a visual overview of spatiotemporal data that considers the objects' spatial extent and strives to show spatial interactions among these objects by displaying spatial intersections. Like previous techniques, our method involves projecting the spatial coordinates to 1D to produce compact summaries. However, our solution's core consists of performing a layout optimization step that sets the size and positions of the visual marks on the summary to resemble the actual values on the original space. We also provide multiple interactive mechanisms to make interpreting the results more straightforward for the user. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and usage scenarios. Moreover, we evaluated the usefulness of MoReVis in a study with 9 participants. The results point out the effectiveness and suitability of our method in representing different datasets compared to traditional techniques.","authors":["Giovani Valdrighi","Nivan Ferreira","Jorge Poco"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10057127/v-tvcg-10057127_Preview.mp4?token=ES0NVBZKC4BbFSLtFLUMKqxXbZACeYa8NFiBinughDI&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10057127/v-tvcg-10057127_Preview.vtt?token=Kr0SMP8LzDWxKiCu2JohSccIVXruiDLk_E0u3wQurXI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10057127/v-tvcg-10057127_Presentation.mp4?token=dOeG4eVSE61LvSDLDu705eMWACCtBiJDq0_w1RXv2po&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10057127/v-tvcg-10057127_Presentation.vtt?token=qXBxoiKFyL9ANA5VO1vbXfsaIFmNL4ewj1ty88-4qMg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Giovani Valdrighi"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3250166","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10057127","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"MoReVis is a visualization technique designed for spatiotemporal datasets of Moving Regions, entities with a spatial extension that evolves through time.

These geo-networks can be analyzed from multiple levels, ranging from the macro-level of summarizing all geo-networks, meso-level of comparing or summarizing parts of geo-networks, and micro-level of inspecting individual geo-networks. Most of the existing visualizations cannot support multilevel analysis well. These techniques work by: 1) showing geo-networks separately with multiple maps leads to heavy context switching costs between different maps; 2) summarizing all geo-networks into a single network can lead to the loss of individual information; 3) drawing all geo-networks onto one map might suffer from the visual scalability issue in distinguishing individual geo-networks. In this study, we propose GeoNetverse, a novel visualization technique for analyzing aggregate geo-networks from multiple levels. Inspired by metro maps, GeoNetverse balances the overview and details of the geo-networks by placing the edges shared between geo-networks in a stacked manner. To enhance the visual scalability, GeoNetverse incorporates a level-of-detail rendering, a progressive crossing minimization, and a coloring technique. A set of evaluations was conducted to evaluate GeoNetverse from multiple perspectives.","authors":["Zikun Deng","Shifu Chen","Xiao Xie","Guodao Sun","Mingliang Xu","Di Weng","Yingcai Wu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9991899/v-tvcg-9991899_Preview.mp4?token=5XfwobgNzbBLvfeSXpOqRRkvUDyWzlOhXCmnpZLbKyQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9991899/v-tvcg-9991899_Preview.vtt?token=WN9sOQchJDJdXSm26lUpUMVQ2d1DSznaEvBEZgT-NgY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9991899/v-tvcg-9991899_Presentation.mp4?token=-KDmZPY5FZtueNMN1W6_nGk78Rm5rzESL8QjYfda8Nw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9991899/v-tvcg-9991899_Presentation.vtt?token=CmKlhKlkOqpVNdrqNH1AvQDuf_z3-EbBMwFKIwDdM5M&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Zikun Deng"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3229953","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9991899","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"A novel visualization is proposed for depicting mutliple geo-network on the map.

Object detection underpins the ability of scene understanding in such systems. However, existing object detection algorithms often behave as a black box, so when a model fails, no information is available on When, Where and How the failure happened. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to help model developers interpret the model failures. The system includes the micro- and macro-interpreting modules to address the interpretability problem of object detection in autonomous driving. The micro-interpreting module extracts and visualizes the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with density maps, while the macro-interpreting module provides spatial-temporal information of an autonomous driving vehicle and its environment. With the situation awareness of the spatial, temporal and neural network information, our system facilitates the understanding of the results of object detection algorithms, and helps the model developers better understand, tune and develop the models. We use real-world autonomous driving data to perform case studies by involving domain experts in computer vision and autonomous driving to evaluate our system. The results from our interviews with them show the effectiveness of our approach.","authors":["Junhong Wang","Yun Li","Zhaoyu Zhou","Chengshun Wang","Yijie Hou","Li Zhang","Xiangyang Xue","Michael Kamp","Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang","Siming Chen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9870679/v-tvcg-9870679_Preview.mp4?token=lH2oTjB-gRr1P4bdRd8UgIM_SCyA-KJHFC4FpMTvhZA&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9870679/v-tvcg-9870679_Preview.vtt?token=r1MnV6QsRwk_QOzBn3jRSriSG0llJ6Tv0LiF-mTFGo8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9870679/v-tvcg-9870679_Presentation.mp4?token=yg00a3nMZhvhxMBWb-AbZ-P1Wf3_uBd6P-LzIdAYRck&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9870679/v-tvcg-9870679_Presentation.vtt?token=xmGpZMadiy44ylWuzD72dKf7L45wfjVTtd3AqND0cLE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Siming Chen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3201101","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9870679","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"System User Interface: (a) Micro-interpreting module: feature visualization including Density Map and Object Projection; (b) Macro-interpreting module: temporal visualization including Autonomous Driving Vehicle States and Object-level Density Maps; (c) Macro-interpreting module: spatial visualization including Scene and Trajectory; (d) Control for selecting and filtering object classes, results and locations.

These types of analyses focus on answering why questions about underlying spatial phenomena, e.g., why is crime higher in this locale, why do children in one school district outperform those in another, etc.? Answers to these questions require explanations of the model structure, the choice of parameters, and contextualization of the findings with respect to their geographic context. This is particularly true for local forms of regression models which are focused on the role of locational context in determining human behavior. In this paper, we present GeoExplainer, a visual analytics framework designed to support analysts in creating explanative documentation that summarizes and contextualizes their spatial analyses. As analysts create their spatial models, our framework flags potential issues with model parameter selections, utilizes template-based text generation to summarize model outputs, and links with external knowledge repositories to provide annotations that help to explain the model results. As analysts explore the model results, all visualizations and annotations can be captured in an interactive report generation widget. We demonstrate our framework using a case study modeling the determinants of voting in the 2016 US Presidential Election.","authors":["Fan Lei","Yuxin Ma","Stewart Fotheringham","Elizabeth Mack","Ziqi Li","Mehak Sachdeva","Sarah Bardin","Ross Maciejewski"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1343/v-full-1343_Preview.mp4?token=uT-fML8N4tSQhnHBwzp4WHUs6wg_z3CgshA3fPr_lNY&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1343/v-full-1343_Preview.vtt?token=4-MZghNOAZOr7wREbUPP5JWkGyuZy6cqK6ujZMOsGro&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1343/v-full-1343_Presentation.mp4?token=5XADYm3VyNNY9Tn9dGd_eUOl8BvVn7MNmXPZRJHuxTc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1343/v-full-1343_Presentation.vtt?token=rXHKT9tn3HFGk459NIWTgw9cOdxs3rNhgg2yIfIy9d8&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Fan Lei"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327359","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The model analysis and report authoring interface of GeoExplainer.","keywords":["Spatial data analysis, local models, multiscale geographically weighted regression, model explanation, visual analytics"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full7","slot_id":"v-full-1343","time_end":"2023-10-26T23:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T22:48:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T22:48:00Z","title":"GeoExplainer: A Visual Analytics Framework for Spatial Modeling Contextualization and Report Generation","uid":"v-full-1343","youtube_ff_id":"mkM05Rwi8Pw","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/mkM05Rwi8Pw","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to use new advances in data collection, management, and analysis to address their problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights. In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges. When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort.

We extend the existing data extraction strategy of Draco with a data processing architecture capable of extracting features of interest from the knowledge base. A revised version of the ASP grammar provides the basis for this data processing strategy. The resulting incorporated and shared features of the constraints are then visualized using a hypergraph structure inside the radial-arranged constraints of the elaborated visualization. The hierarchical categories of the constraints are indicated by arcs surrounding the constraints. Our approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to interactively explore the design rules' violations based on highlighting respective constraints or recommendations.

DIVI deconstructs Scalable Vector Graphics charts at runtime to infer content and coordinate user input, decoupling interaction from specification logic. This decoupling allows interactions to extend and compose freely across different tools, chart types, and analysis goals. DIVI exploits positional relations of marks to detect chart components such as axes and legends, reconstruct scales and view encodings, and infer data fields.

Yet support for uncertainty visualization in the grammar graphics\u2014beyond simple variations of error bars, uncertainty bands, and density plots\u2014remains rudimentary. Research in uncertainty visualization has developed a rich variety of improved uncertainty visualizations, most of which are difficult to create in existing grammar of graphics implementations. ggdist, an extension to the popular ggplot2 grammar of graphics toolkit, is an attempt to rectify this situation. ggdist unifies a variety of uncertainty visualization types through the lens of distributional visualization, allowing functions of distributions to be mapped to directly to visual channels (aesthetics), making it straightforward to express a variety of (sometimes weird!) uncertainty visualization types. This distributional lens also offers a way to unify Bayesian and frequentist uncertainty visualization by formalizing the latter with the help of confidence distributions. In this paper, I offer a description of this uncertainty visualization paradigm and lessons learned from its development and adoption: ggdist has existed in some form for about six years (originally as part of the tidybayes R package for post-processing Bayesian models), and it has evolved substantially over that time, with several rewrites and API re-organizations as it changed in response to user feedback and expanded to cover increasing varieties of uncertainty visualization types. Ultimately, given the huge expressive power of the grammar of graphics and the popularity of tools built on it, I hope a catalog of my experience with ggdist will provide a catalyst for further improvements to formalizations and implementations of uncertainty visualization in grammar of graphics ecosystems.

Programmatic notations use symbols defined by grammars or domain-specific languages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, Vega-Lite) or libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Pandas).   Designers and prospective users of grammars and libraries often evaluate visualization notations by inspecting galleries of examples.  While such collections demonstrate usage and expressiveness, their construction and evaluation are usually ad hoc, making comparisons of different notations difficult.  More rarely, experts analyze notations via usability heuristics, such as the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. These analyses, akin to structured close readings of text, can reveal design deficiencies, but place a burden on the expert to simultaneously consider many facets of often complex systems.  To alleviate these issues, we introduce a metrics-based approach to usability evaluation and comparison of notations in which metrics are computed for a gallery of examples across a suite of notations.  While applicable to any visualization domain, we explore the utility of our approach via a case study considering statistical graphics that explores 40 visualizations across 9 widely used notations. We facilitate the computation of appropriate metrics and analysis via a new tool called NotaScope.  We gathered feedback via interviews with authors or maintainers of prominent charting libraries  (n=6).  We find that this approach is a promising way to formalize, externalize, and extend evaluations and comparisons of visualization notations.","authors":["Nicolas Kruchten","Andrew M McNutt","Michael McGuffin"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1328/v-full-1328_Preview.mp4?token=hBlgJcFbyl1604BdDie-9WmIyDnxEwbAPeANkTjKdek&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1328/v-full-1328_Preview.vtt?token=9XXEut_CtOQGrMO1oRR1RfyRbOTYfHSb0cuqriDK8Q4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1328/v-full-1328_Presentation.mp4?token=VoWXWHr4MZQnZ05UdcJnbMxMpkUWyKwEpOPmNeyNMwk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1328/v-full-1328_Presentation.vtt?token=GZVdNu0uh3qLIh7QBlfKqXztecYd1rCeC7197c47juw&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Michael J.

However, existing deconstruction approaches primarily focus on chart styles, handling only basic layouts. In this paper, we investigate how to deconstruct chart layouts, focusing on rectangle-based ones, as they cover not only 17 chart types but also advanced layouts (e.g., small multiples, nested layouts). We develop an interactive tool, called Mystique, adopting a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legend, and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Mystique employs a wizard interface that guides chart authors through a series of steps to specify how the deconstructed components map to their own data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts, Mystique achieves above 85% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96% accuracy for layout deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions.","authors":["Chen Chen","Bongshin Lee","Yunhai Wang","Yunjeong Chang","Zhicheng Liu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1199/v-full-1199_Preview.mp4?token=R-eaPHTE1e9MHhP7cCH1VLihctirAKY3Zzz-vY9eG1c&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1199/v-full-1199_Preview.vtt?token=93akIKaW2caMFMrhwJlRoWI9Icr10400m9nyh74eTeQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1199/v-full-1199_Presentation.mp4?token=kLWWG8FB2GTveAbEL6JuSSUieLFi-aTw0lIwmW2Msac&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1199/v-full-1199_Presentation.vtt?token=Ly9h3oIF2J0oQPn7xa0twhDtdK21NBKaSyL4elAo8Eg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Chen Chen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327354","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Each pair shows an existing chart (left) and a new chart created using Mystique (right).

At the heart of this revolutionary technology are quantum circuits, which serve as vital tools for implementing, analyzing, and optimizing quantum algorithms. Recent advancements in quantum computing and the increasing capability of quantum devices have led to the development of more complex quantum circuits. However, traditional quantum circuit diagrams suffer from scalability and readability issues, which limit the efficiency of analysis and optimization processes. In this research, we propose a novel visualization approach for large-scale quantum circuits by adopting semantic analysis to facilitate the comprehension of quantum circuits. We first exploit meta-data and semantic information extracted from the underlying code of quantum circuits to create component segmentations and pattern abstractions, allowing for easier wrangling of massive circuit diagrams.

A series of novel circuit visualizations is designed to uncover contextual details such as qubit provenance, parallelism, and entanglement. The effectiveness of Quantivine is demonstrated through two usage scenarios of quantum circuits with up to 100 qubits and a formal user evaluation with quantum experts.

The popularity of online social networking platforms makes them the prime venues to advertise products and promote opinions. The Influence Maximization (IM) problem entails selecting a seed set of users that maximizes the influence spread, i.e., the expected number of users positively influenced by a stochastic diffusion process triggered by the seeds. Engineering and analyzing IM algorithms remains a difficult and demanding task due to the NP-hardness of the problem and the stochastic nature of the diffusion processes. Despite several heuristics being introduced, they often fail in providing enough information on how the network topology affects the diffusion process, precious insights that could help researchers improve their seed set selection. In this paper, we present VAIM, a visual analytics system that supports users in analyzing, evaluating, and comparing information diffusion processes determined by different IM algorithms. Furthermore, VAIM provides useful insights that the analyst can use to modify the seed set of an IM algorithm, so to improve its influence spread. We assess our system by: (i) a qualitative evaluation based on a guided experiment with two domain experts on two different data sets; (ii) a quantitative estimation of the value of the proposed visualization through the ICE-T methodology by Wall (IEEE TVCG - 2018). The twofold assessment indicates that VAIM effectively supports our target users in the visual analysis of the performance of IM algorithms.","authors":["Alessio Arleo","Walter Didimo","Giuseppe Liotta","Silvia Miksch","Fabrizio Montecchiani"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9829321/v-tvcg-9829321_Preview.mp4?token=Q8TWAp8laAmU2GKi2Ezf4mUEIyFmKqRNAEy52khRTBk&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9829321/v-tvcg-9829321_Preview.vtt?token=6VEQI4IBjBxAmCxGhfYAt-2N9pS1UO2Agesqpv5rg00&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9829321/v-tvcg-9829321_Presentation.mp4?token=mI4STObcckslDl6ePy2RoyL8D0WNvsufXWdmmaI5IN0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9829321/v-tvcg-9829321_Presentation.vtt?token=J7cE2lBefdc_v5HCpuID0Q1KSjQp7cyE5uqi1zPtVgI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Alessio Arleo"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3190623","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9829321","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"A Snapshot of VAIM, a Visual Analytics System for Influence Maximization.","keywords":["Information visualization;visualization systems and software;influence maximization;visual analytics;information diffusion"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full9","slot_id":"v-tvcg-9829321","time_end":"2023-10-25T05:33:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T05:21:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T05:21:00Z","title":"Influence Maximization with Visual Analytics","uid":"v-tvcg-9829321","youtube_ff_id":"SSoCivECraQ","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/SSoCivECraQ","youtube_prerecorded_id":"woxn4A6K4Ng","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/woxn4A6K4Ng"},{"abstract":"This study presents insights from interviews with nineteen Knowledge Graph (KG) practitioners who work in both enterprise and academic settings on a wide variety of use cases.

Our findings reveal three major personas among KG practitioners -- KG Builders, Analysts, and Consumers -- each of whom have their own distinct expertise and needs. We discover that KG Builders would benefit from schema enforcers, while KG Analysts need customizable query builders that provide interim query results. For KG Consumers, we identify a lack of efficacy for node-link diagrams, and the need for tailored domain-specific visualizations to promote KG adoption and comprehension. Lastly, we find that implementing KGs effectively in practice requires both technical and social solutions that are not addressed with current tools, technologies, and collaborative workflows. From the analysis of our interviews, we distill several visualization research directions to improve KG usability, including knowledge cards that balance digestibility and discoverability, timeline views to track temporal changes, interfaces that support organic discovery, and semantic explanations for AI and machine learning predictions.","authors":["Harry Li","Gabriel Appleby","Camelia D.

Recently, a polygon-based representation for hypergraphs has been proposed with demonstrated benefits. However, the polygon-based layout often suffers from excessive self-intersections when the input dataset is relatively large. In this paper, we propose a framework in which the hypergraph is iteratively simplified through a set of atomic operations. Then, the layout of the simplest hypergraph is optimized and used as the foundation for a reverse process that brings the simplest hypergraph back to the original one, but with an improved layout. At the core of our approach is the set of atomic simplification operations and an operation priority measure to guide the simplification process. In addition, we introduce necessary definitions and conditions for hypergraph planarity within the polygon representation. We extend our approach to handle simultaneous simplification and layout optimization for both the hypergraph and its dual. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with datasets from a number of real-world applications.","authors":["Peter D Oliver","Eugene Zhang","Yue Zhang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1564/v-full-1564_Preview.mp4?token=dp4q4jHS50vbSQ_k5CHrNnpnMPW8tH4DskryWpkPcDE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1564/v-full-1564_Preview.vtt?token=SMHZQusIw_ahjzcVIEwN9KfVrlwwTIcXK5vfHgcPYzk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1564/v-full-1564_Presentation.mp4?token=qLNpWRIv-HbxBJunpfZVn98J0fcBCDOYy3ywIoCWebA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1564/v-full-1564_Presentation.vtt?token=PK-kvagiQgMKrIy_RlDi12oKKPqpWu8Eo7FMdjF4lzg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Peter Oliver"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326599","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We present a scalable layout optimization framework for polygon visualizations of hypergraphs.

Existing methods of streaming high-dimensional data visualization primarily line up essential modules in a serial manner and often face challenges in satisfying all these design considerations. In this research, we propose a novel parallel framework for streaming high-dimensional data visualization to achieve high data processing speed, high quality in data patterns, and good stability in visual presentations. This framework arranges all essential modules in parallel to mitigate the delays caused by module waiting in serial setups. In addition, to facilitate the parallel pipeline, we redesign these modules with a parametric non-linear embedding method for new data embedding, an incremental learning method for online embedding function updating, and a hybrid strategy for optimized embedding updating. We also improve the coordination mechanism among these modules.

Analyzing and understanding the query execution process of these systems are daily routines for engineers and crucial for identifying performance problems, optimizing system configurations, and rectifying errors. However, existing visualization tools for distributed query execution are insufficient because (i) most of them (if not all) do not provide fine-grained visualization (i.e., the atomic task level), which can be crucial for understanding query performance and reasoning about the underlying execution anomalies, and (ii) they do not support proper linkages between system status and query execution, which makes it difficult to identify the causes of execution problems. To tackle these limitations, we propose QEVIS, which visualizes distributed query execution process with multiple views that focus on different granularities and complement each other. Specifically, we first devise a query logical plan layout algorithm to visualize the overall query execution progress compactly and clearly. We then propose two novel scoring methods to summarize the anomaly degrees of the jobs and machines during query execution, and visualize the anomaly scores intuitively, which allow users to easily identify the components that are worth paying attention to. Moreover, we devise a scatter plot-based task view to show a massive number of atomic tasks, where task distribution patterns are informative for execution problems. We also equip QEVIS with a suite of auxiliary views and interaction methods to support easy and effective cross-view exploration, which makes it convenient to track the causes of execution problems. QEVIS has been used in the production environment of our industry partner, and we present three use cases from real-world applications and user interview to demonstrate its effectiveness.

It is used in various applications, such as image recognition, single-cell sequencing analysis, and biomarker discovery. However, contemporary parametric-free and parametric DR techniques suffer from several significant shortcomings, such as the inability to preserve global and local features and the pool generalization performance. On the other hand, regarding explainability, it is crucial to comprehend the embedding process, especially the contribution of each part to the embedding process, while understanding how each feature affects the embedding results that identify critical components and help diagnose the embedding process. To address these problems, we have developed a deep neural network method called EVNet, which provides not only excellent performance in structural maintainability but also explainability to the DR therein. EVNet starts with data augmentation and a manifold-based loss function to improve embedding performance. The explanation is based on saliency maps and aims to examine the trained EVNet parameters and contributions of components during the embedding process. The proposed techniques are integrated with a visual interface to help the user to adjust EVNet to achieve better DR performance and explainability. The interactive visual interface makes it easier to illustrate the data features, compare different DR techniques, and investigate DR. An in-depth experimental comparison shows that EVNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both performance measures and explainability.","authors":["Zelin Zang","Shenghui Cheng","Linyan Lu","Hanchen Xia","Liangyu Li","Yaoting Sun","Yongjie Xu","Lei Shang","Baigui Sun","Stan Z.

Class probabilities represent the likelihood that each instance belongs to a particular class, which can be produced by probabilistic classifiers or even human labeling with uncertainty. Since both perspectives are multi-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used to extract informative characteristics from them. However, existing methods either focus solely on the data feature perspective or rely on class probability estimates to guide the DR process. In contrast to previous work where separate views are linked to conduct the analysis, we propose a novel approach, class-constrained t-SNE, that combines data features and class probabilities in the same DR result. Specifically, we combine them by balancing two corresponding components in a cost function to optimize the positions of data points and iconic representation of classes -- class landmarks. Furthermore, an interactive user-adjustable parameter balances these two components so that users can focus on the weighted perspectives of interest and also empowers a smooth visual transition between varying perspectives to preserve the mental map.

Tailor-made visual analytics software is developed for each specific application, limiting their applicability in other fields. However, as diverse as these fields are, their characteristics and requirements for data analysis are conceptually similar. Many applications share abstract tasks and data types and are often constructed with similar building blocks. Developing such applications, even when based mostly on existing building blocks, requires significant engineering efforts. We developed ManiVault, a flexible and extensible open-source visual analytics framework for analyzing high-dimensional data. The primary objective of ManiVault is to facilitate rapid prototyping of visual analytics workflows for visualization software developers and practitioners alike. ManiVault is built using a plugin-based architecture that offers easy extensibility. While our architecture deliberately keeps plugins self-contained, to guarantee maximum flexibility and re-usability, we have designed and implemented a messaging API for tight integration and linking of modules to support common visual analytics design patterns. We provide several visualization and analytics plugins, and ManiVault's API makes the integration of new plugins easy for developers. ManiVault facilitates the distribution of visualization and analysis pipelines and results for practitioners through saving and reproducing complete application states. As such, ManiVault can be used as a communication tool among researchers to discuss workflows and results.

An essential phase in UXO detection is the task of image selection, where a small subset of images must be chosen from archives to reconstruct an area of interest (AOI) and identify craters. The selected image set must comply with good spatial and temporal coverage over the AOI, particularly in the temporal vicinity of recorded aerial attacks, and do so with minimal images for resource optimization. This paper presents a guidance-enhanced visual analytics prototype to select images for UXO detection. In close collaboration with domain experts, our design process involved analyzing user tasks, eliciting expert knowledge, modeling quality metrics, and choosing appropriate guidance. We report on a user study with two real-world scenarios of image selection performed with and without guidance. Our solution was well-received and deemed highly usable. Through the lens of our task-based design and developed quality measures, we observed guidance-driven changes in user behavior and improved quality of analysis results. An expert evaluation of the study allowed us to improve our guidance-enhanced prototype further and discuss new possibilities for user-adaptive guidance.","authors":["Ignacio P\u00e9rez-Messina","Davide Ceneda","Silvia Miksch"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1515/v-full-1515_Preview.mp4?token=uB-kzDLiMYHDHwSPmwCpRF8N9apGjIfASUVeOtLOCSE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1515/v-full-1515_Preview.vtt?token=BAyFPIepM-M3vG-kNRPmXp2nGSDhL3f222Fq7p8nyME&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1515/v-full-1515_Presentation.mp4?token=ulr95_1wD_EP5_rc_Q5L1d8a_7Z062bwwWK0uICGuNo&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1515/v-full-1515_Presentation.vtt?token=vvJ31naklxlO2yjtX7zxLn8IkrZT1jNjnug2dhc5INE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Ignacio P\u00e9rez-Messina"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326572","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"To enhance the UXO detection expert's decision-making process, our guided VA system for image selection in UXO detection visualizes image metadata in time while providing orientation (blue) and recommendations (red), employing an optimisation model that adapts to the user's selection (green).","keywords":["Application Motivated Visualization, Geospatial Data, Mixed Initiative Human-Machine Analysis, Process/Workflow Design, Task Abstractions & Application Domains, Temporal Data"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full11","slot_id":"v-full-1515","time_end":"2023-10-24T22:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-24T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-24T22:00:00Z","title":"Guided Visual Analytics for Image Selection in Time and Space","uid":"v-full-1515","youtube_ff_id":"3P6-uz4Cun8","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/3P6-uz4Cun8","youtube_prerecorded_id":"HzGQ6yczMPI","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/HzGQ6yczMPI"},{"abstract":"High-quality visualization collections are beneficial for a variety of applications including visualization reference and data-driven visualization design. The visualization community has created many visualization collections, and developed interactive exploration systems for the collections. However, the systems are mainly based on extrinsic attributes like authors and publication years, whilst neglect intrinsic property ( i.e ., visual appearance) of visualizations, hindering visual comparison and query of visualization designs. This paper presents VISAtlas , an image-based approach empowered by neural image embedding, to facilitate exploration and query for visualization collections. To improve embedding accuracy, we create a comprehensive collection of synthetic and real-world visualizations, and use it to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a triplet loss for taxonomical classification of visualizations. Next, we design a coordinated multiple view (CMV) system that enables multi-perspective exploration and design retrieval based on visualization embeddings. Specifically, we design a novel embedding overview that leverages contextual layout framework to preserve the context of the embedding vectors with the associated visualization taxonomies, and density plot and sampling techniques to address the overdrawing problem. We demonstrate in three case studies and one user study the effectiveness of VISAtlas in supporting comparative analysis of visualization collections, exploration of composite visualizations, and image-based retrieval of visualization designs. The studies reveal that real-world visualization collections ( e.g ., Beagle and VIS30K) better accord with the richness and diversity of visualization designs than synthetic collections ( e.g ., Data2Vis), inspiring composite visualizations are identified in real-world collections, and distinct design patterns exist in visualizations from different sources.","authors":["Yilin Ye","Rong Huang","Wei Zeng"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9984953/v-tvcg-9984953_Preview.mp4?token=A_dpRpMp0XAV7afzwkqv2YwsEEUbCTsoAc_Zp9huS3M&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9984953/v-tvcg-9984953_Preview.vtt?token=rUh0Q1jMAbYMiobjTA1cKW8sXiswcUC4vvsye_DcuTY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9984953/v-tvcg-9984953_Presentation.mp4?token=wRzf7fyUzmVAFcYCpINYphO1zh_OAhSfaeJTVS90FiM&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9984953/v-tvcg-9984953_Presentation.vtt?token=pB6GbhLsKpKGky8kXl6CXDHM3C9JV0HSyh0UdtxcoJk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Yilin Ye"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3229023","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9984953","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Visualization image collections are valuable for learning visualization, training AI, and inspiring design.

Most of the existing methods and commercial applications for generating image collages are designed on simple shapes, such as rectangular and circular layouts. This greatly limits the use of image collages in some artistic and creative settings. Although there are some methods that can generate irregularly-shaped image collages, they often suffer from severe image overlapping and excessive blank space. This prevents such methods from being effective information communication tools. In this paper, we present a shape slicing algorithm and an optimization scheme that can create image collages of arbitrary shapes in an informative and visually pleasing manner given an input shape and an image collection. To overcome the challenge of irregular shapes, we propose a novel algorithm, called Shape-Aware Slicing, which partitions the input shape into cells based on medial axis and binary slicing tree. Shape-Aware Slicing, which is designed specifically for irregular shapes, takes human perception and shape structure into account to generate visually pleasing partitions. Then, the layout is optimized by analyzing input images with the goal of maximizing the total salient regions of the images. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments and compare our results against previous work. The evaluations show that our proposed algorithm can efficiently arrange image collections on irregular shapes and create visually superior results than prior work and existing commercial tools.","authors":["Dong-Yi Wu","Thi-Ngoc-Hanh Le","Sheng-Yi Yao","Yun-Chen Lin","Tong-Yee Lee"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10081386/v-tvcg-10081386_Preview.mp4?token=wd70LPRp_bQXPPx02hlnhjidsKPvXYqFFO-MIWSc5To&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10081386/v-tvcg-10081386_Preview.vtt?token=Cu-_QfJZGeRAgmXGPmGXeNW1xmmOD1LeJPiC-hlFNMQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10081386/v-tvcg-10081386_Presentation.mp4?token=eR0snRlNrqOhRYvH-CW7uxYLb7YTkDXyWb0JPJNxDRg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10081386/v-tvcg-10081386_Presentation.vtt?token=_J_FV9mmU3kW0vYS0P7_y9k9FPXqCbOgujhyXXjD78s&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Dong-Yi Wu"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3262039","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10081386","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Image Collage on Arbitrary Shape via Shape-Aware Slicing and Optimization","keywords":["Image collection visualization;image collage;irregular shape layout"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full11","slot_id":"v-tvcg-10081386","time_end":"2023-10-24T22:36:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-24T22:24:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-24T22:24:00Z","title":"Image Collage on Arbitrary Shape via Shape-Aware Slicing and Optimization","uid":"v-tvcg-10081386","youtube_ff_id":"ANQ590xHKwA","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/ANQ590xHKwA","youtube_prerecorded_id":"K86NPBRc0xA","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/K86NPBRc0xA"},{"abstract":"Images in visualization publications contain rich information, e.g., novel visualization designs and implicit design patterns of visualizations.

While data programming shows promise in generating labeled data at scale with user-defined labeling functions, the high dimensional and complex temporal information in videos poses additional challenges for effectively composing and evaluating labeling functions. In this paper, we propose VideoPro, a visual analytics approach to support flexible and scalable video data programming for model steering with reduced human effort. We first extract human-understandable events from videos using computer vision techniques and treat them as atomic components of labeling functions. We further propose a two-stage template mining algorithm that characterizes the sequential patterns of these events to serve as labeling function templates for efficient data labeling. The visual interface of VideoPro facilitates multifaceted exploration, examination, and application of the labeling templates, allowing for effective programming of video data at scale. Moreover, users can monitor the impact of programming on model performance and make informed adjustments during the iterative programming process.

To gain a competitive edge at high-level competitions, badminton professionals frequently analyze match videos to gain insights and develop game strategies. However, the current process for analyzing matches is time-consuming and relies heavily on manual note-taking, due to the lack of automatic data collection and appropriate visualization tools. As a result, there is a gap in effectively analyzing matches and communicating insights among badminton coaches and players. This work proposes an end-to-end immersive match analysis pipeline designed in close collaboration with badminton professionals, including Olympic and national coaches and players. We present VIRD, a VR Bird (i.e., shuttle) immersive analysis tool, that supports interactive badminton game analysis in an immersive environment based on 3D reconstructed game views of the match video. We propose a top-down analytic workflow that allows users to seamlessly move from a high-level match overview to a detailed game view of individual rallies and shots, using situated 3D visualizations and video. We collect 3D spatial and dynamic shot data and player poses with computer vision models and visualize them in VR. Through immersive visualizations, coaches can interactively analyze situated spatial data (player positions, poses, and shot trajectories) with flexible viewpoints while navigating between shots and rallies effectively with embodied interaction. We evaluated the usefulness of VIRD with Olympic and national-level coaches and players in real matches. Results show that immersive analytics supports effective badminton match analysis with reduced context-switching costs and enhances spatial understanding with a high sense of presence.","authors":["Tica Lin","Alexandre Aouididi","Zhutian Chen","Johanna Beyer","Hanspeter Pfister","Jui-Hsien Wang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1103/v-full-1103_Preview.mp4?token=zTXIziVBmdfHH2Di-ZMUE0Y2QTZX16V36DByu-KZ4Pk&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1103/v-full-1103_Preview.vtt?token=frdGya5ZxP7iAN9AdNfA5efq2HJzfhJr1gxc575m1_Q&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1103/v-full-1103_Presentation.mp4?token=I6x3PQn7TCGA3ZT-mT67d82Vkh6DFzZUwBivlFQBCiE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1103/v-full-1103_Presentation.vtt?token=mMA8E2Pr32fZj8DiqeljLiPiaW6ECgNcLWsTuMTB64c&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Tica Lin"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327161","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"{\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\cocoartf2709 \\cocoatextscaling0\\cocoaplatform0{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss\\fcharset0 ArialMT;\\f1\\froman\\fcharset0 Times-Roman;} {\\colortbl;\\red255\\green255\\blue255;\\red0\\green0\\blue0;} {\\*\\expandedcolortbl;;\\cssrgb\\c0\\c0\\c0;} \\margl1440\\margr1440\\vieww24000\\viewh16320\\viewkind0 \\deftab720 \\pard\\pardeftab720\\partightenfactor0  \\f0\\fs29\\fsmilli14667 \\cf0 \\expnd0\\expndtw0\\kerning0 \\outl0\\strokewidth0 \\strokec2 VIRD, VR Bird, is a VR video analysis tool for badminton coaches and players to effectively analyze badminton match with multi-modal data. \\f1\\fs24 \\  \\f0\\fs29\\fsmilli14667 Users can experience the dynamic 3D poses and ball trajectories in VR, and analyze game data with situated visualizations.\\'a0 \\f1\\fs24 \\  \\f0\\fs29\\fsmilli14667 We contributed to a semi-automatic pipeline, where the coaches only need to provide a game video, and can later analyze the game in VR with all the supporting 3D views and data. \\f1\\fs24 \\ }","keywords":["Sports Analytics, Immersive Analytics, Data Visualization"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full12","slot_id":"v-full-1103","time_end":"2023-10-25T03:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T03:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T03:00:00Z","title":"VIRD: Immersive Match Video Analysis for High-Performance Badminton Coaching","uid":"v-full-1103","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"LxEuKLl9JJA","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/LxEuKLl9JJA"},{"abstract":"Immersive visualization in virtual reality (VR) allows us to exploit visual cues for perception in 3D space, yet few existing studies have measured the effects of visual cues. Across a desktop monitor and a head-mounted display (HMD), we assessed scatterplot designs which vary their use of visual cues\u2014motion, shading, perspective (graphical projection), and dimensionality\u2014on two sets of data. We conducted a user study with a summary task in which 32 participants estimated the classification accuracy of an artificial neural network from the scatterplots. With Bayesian multilevel modeling, we capture the intricate visual effects and find that no cue alone explains all the variance in estimation error. Visual motion cues generally reduce participants\u2019 estimation error; besides this motion, using other cues may increase participants\u2019 estimation error. Using an HMD, adding visual motion cues, providing a third data dimension, or showing a more complicated dataset leads to longer response times. We speculate that most visual cues may not strongly affect perception in immersive analytics unless they change people\u2019s mental model about data. In summary, by studying participants as they interpret the output from a complicated machine learning model, we advance our understanding of how to use the visual cues in immersive analytics.","authors":["Fumeng Yang","James Tompkin","Lane Harrison","David H.

Therefore, we studied this impact for several commonly occurring tasks related to MLN analysis.

We ran a human subject study utilising a Virtual Reality headset to evaluate 2D, 2.5D, and 3D layer arrangements. The study employs six analysis tasks that cover the spectrum of an MLN task taxonomy, from path finding and pattern identification to comparisons between and across layers.

Each technique is designed to be adjusted to particular selection intents: the selection of consecutive dense regions, the selection of filament-like structures, and the selection of clusters\u2014with all of them facilitating post-selection threshold adjustment. These techniques allow users to precisely select those regions of space for further exploration\u2014with simple and approximate 3D pointing, brushing, or drawing input\u2014using flexible point- or path-based input and without being limited by 3D occlusions, non-homogeneous feature density, or complex data shapes. These new techniques are evaluated in a controlled experiment and compared with the Baseline method, a region-based 3D painting selection. Our results indicate that our techniques are effective in handling a wide range of scenarios and allow users to select data based on their comprehension of crucial features. Furthermore, we analyze the attributes, requirements, and strategies of our spatial selection methods and compare them with existing state-of-the-art selection methods to handle diverse data features and situations. Based on this analysis we provide guidelines for choosing the most suitable 3D spatial selection techniques based on the interaction environment, the given data characteristics, or the need for interactive post-selection threshold adjustment.","authors":["Lixiang Zhao","Tobias Isenberg","Fuqi Xie","Hai-Ning Liang","Lingyun Yu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1431/v-full-1431_Preview.mp4?token=dJ5l8IydIF7caxnZOyhTcsaDAVE7tgEZqntMwdXc3jg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1431/v-full-1431_Preview.vtt?token=lGu0tNB3VwClY9TLSSXUVvb_dTra9hjtcvAlmRQ_sso&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1431/v-full-1431_Presentation.mp4?token=IunojNVWtwekUxhQxRRa3OxOJfgW_hWoJI5o-wv0AYo&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1431/v-full-1431_Presentation.vtt?token=X4lzJkofk6LzJ81kDTVBYkEeBKmpeh5vkDJ4CqMtOdM&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Lixiang Zhao"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326517","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"MeTACAST is a family of three target- and context-aware spatial selection techniques for 3D point cloud data in VR environments.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 73 studies published between 2013-2022 on immersive analytics systems and visualizations, aiming to identify and categorize the primary dimensions influencing their design. We identified five key dimensions: Academic Theory and Contribution, Immersive Technology, Data, Spatial Presentation, and Visual Presentation. Academic Theory and Contribution assess the motivations behind the works and their theoretical frameworks. Immersive Technology examines the display and input modalities, while Data dimension focuses on dataset types and generation. Spatial Presentation discusses the environment, space, embodiment, and collaboration aspects in IA, and Visual Presentation explores the visual elements, facet and position, and manipulation of views. By examining each dimension individually and cross-referencing them, this review uncovers trends and relationships that help inform the design of immersive systems visualizations. This analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, offering guidance in designing future immersive analytics systems and shaping the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.

Data visualization has assumed a central role in environmental journalism and is often used in data stories to convey the dramatic consequences of climate change and other ecological crises. However, the emphasis on the catastrophic impacts of climate change tends to induce feelings of fear, anxiety, and apathy in readers. Climate mitigation, adaptation, and protection \u2013 all highly urgent in the face of the climate crisis \u2013 are at risk of being overlooked. These topics are more difficult to communicate as they are hard to convey on varying levels of locality, involve multiple interconnected sectors, and need to be mediated across various channels from the printed newspaper to social media platforms. So far, there has been little research on data visualization to enhance affective engagement with data about climate protection as part of solution-oriented reporting of climate change. With this research we characterize the unique challenges of constructive climate journalism for data visualization and share findings from a research and design study in collaboration with a national newspaper in Germany. Using the affordances and aesthetics of travel postcards, we present Klimakarten, a data journalism project on the progress of climate protection at multiple spatial scales (from national to local), across five key sectors (agriculture, buildings, energy, mobility, and waste), and for print and online use. The findings from quantitative and qualitative analysis of reader feedback confirm our overall approach and suggest implications for future work.","authors":["Francesca Morini","Johanna Hartmann","Anna Eschenbacher","Marian D\u00f6rk"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1144/v-full-1144_Preview.mp4?token=daKomu-REozpa2hZ5LFEi61zt79-F6nt-cqGYsg0tGU&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1144/v-full-1144_Preview.vtt?token=F3Dw8dZF3fSCH632O9ToQrI-r6ku2QG5kmQXUU6OqhU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1144/v-full-1144_Presentation.mp4?token=5ICkYpSf01FxhFa_p_lBAYXIHt91gDAetdg4B4K9Un8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1144/v-full-1144_Presentation.vtt?token=I7InnxbmBxp6CLknvUtQ1lQWxhWkjvHDyufrFOUtSTI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Francesca Morini"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327185","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Four postcards are laid on top of a newspaper page.

However, little research exists on the design rationale for visualization thumbnails, such as resizing, cropping, simplifying, and embellishing charts that appear within the body of the associated article. Therefore, in this paper we aim to understand these design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail inviting and interpretable. To this end, we first survey visualization thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization thumbnail practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study results indicate that different chart components play different roles in attracting reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of the visualization thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design strategies for effectively combining the charts' components, such as a data summary with highlights and data labels, and a visual legend with text labels and Human Recognizable Objects (HROs), into thumbnails. Ultimately, we distill our findings into design implications that allow effective visualization thumbnail designs for data-rich news articles. Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories.","authors":["Hwiyeon Kim","Joohee Kim","Yunha Han","Hwajung Hong","Oh-Sang Kwon","Young-Woo Park","Niklas Elmqvist","Sungahn Ko","Bum Chul Kwon"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10130316/v-tvcg-10130316_Preview.mp4?token=kwQMZGPMyqOigk_POoh6j-nrA_ZSe7-8vZ6IINFDfDM&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10130316/v-tvcg-10130316_Preview.vtt?token=JLRUYMU7JkShQ1gYCW_LeupWLC5C2jzLiMaKMYaJhvk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10130316/v-tvcg-10130316_Presentation.mp4?token=qunw6NdKy8mvO2P235WZzST7Qajy6Hc0SA8LZ_g7sdk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10130316/v-tvcg-10130316_Presentation.vtt?token=phQmniXQywppiEIJumc8mTF1vKa8_qP6xt5KiKm0r1M&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Hwiyeon Kim"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3278304","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10130316","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This study is about design choices of visualization thumbnail for news articles.","keywords":["Data journalism;data stories;data-driven storytelling;online news;thumbnail images;visualization"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full13","slot_id":"v-tvcg-10130316","time_end":"2023-10-26T22:24:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T22:12:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T22:12:00Z","title":"Towards Visualization Thumbnail Designs that Entice Reading Data-driven Articles","uid":"v-tvcg-10130316","youtube_ff_id":"fC93yY3r2Js","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/fC93yY3r2Js","youtube_prerecorded_id":"0zHERZNI6NY","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/0zHERZNI6NY"},{"abstract":"Embellishments are features commonly used in everyday visualisations which are demonstrated to enhance assimilation and memorability. Despite their popularity, little is known about their impact on enticing readers to explore visualisations. To address this gap, we conducted 18 interviews with a diverse group of participants who were consumers of news media but non-experts in visualisation and design. Participants were shown ten embellished and plain visualisations collected from the news and asked to rank them based on enticement and ease of understanding. Extending prior work, our interview results suggest that visualisations with multiple embellishment types might make a visualisation perceived as more enticing. An important finding from our study is that the widespread of certain embellishments in the media might have made them part of visualisation conventions, making a visualisation appear more objective but less enticing. Based on these findings, we ran a follow-up online user study showing participants variations of the visualisations with multiple embellishments to isolate each embellishment type and investigate its effect. We found that variations with salient embellishments were perceived as more enticing. We argue that to unpack the concept of embellishments; we must consider two factors: embellishment saliency and editorial styles. Our study contributes concept and design considerations to the literature concerned with visualisation design for non-experts in visualisation and design.","authors":["Muna Alebri","Enrico Costanza","Georgia Panagiotidou","Duncan P Brumby"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1383/v-full-1383_Preview.mp4?token=XKyEAbIALTfoUJ-ZoCdBR4Of4RdMSNVkcCA2x15shAE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1383/v-full-1383_Preview.vtt?token=-T_Iyh2Sb-TdQtlJL68t7bbnD9-r1yOpF4Q6SFs38cA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1383/v-full-1383_Presentation.mp4?token=jBD0PDIz0wn5-pzmctNEqM9QHN-G9-yR5ohztDk3b9c&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1383/v-full-1383_Presentation.vtt?token=92-2btDSKfbSrTVPkZzr3cF4PR7wT4j4yck1b3Dse5U&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Muna Alebri"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326914","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Revisiting Embellishments: bar charts with salient icons and arrows instead of bars.

For example, could design or framing choices interact with viewers' social cognitive biases in ways that promote political polarization? When reporting on U.S. attitudes toward public policies, it is popular to highlight the gap between Democrats and Republicans (e.g.\\ with blue vs red connected dot plots). But these charts may encourage social-normative conformity, influencing viewers' attitudes to match the divided opinions shown in the visualization. We conducted three experiments examining visualization framing in the context of social conformity and polarization. Crowdworkers viewed charts showing simulated polling results for public policy proposals. We varied framing (aggregating data as non-partisan \u201cAll US Adults,\u201d or partisan \u201cDemocrat\u201d / \u201cRepublican\u201d) and the visualized groups' support levels. Participants then reported their own support for each policy. We found that participants' attitudes biased significantly toward the group attitudes shown in the stimuli and this can increase inter-party attitude divergence.These results demonstrate that data visualizations can induce social conformity and accelerate political polarization. Choosing to visualize partisan divisions can divide us further.","authors":["Eli Holder","Cindy Xiong Bearfield"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1513/v-full-1513_Preview.mp4?token=NrJUq7m6Xv2DAWV__jCG2BJVQOrkF0Qk5JwAN737S-w&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1513/v-full-1513_Preview.vtt?token=26npaP-gZxWQhK2lKjobJNCrQb3GKvnQkUwPrTmySM4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1513/v-full-1513_Presentation.mp4?token=0_FcLwgN0RF7ahg2ELpyH_iQthDzYXPOrppbZudnEnM&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1513/v-full-1513_Presentation.vtt?token=uMB7_5YpGEBcEJpi4D4t6bDBQjTJH5NDrwizXRbhnoY&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Eli Holder"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326512","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":["Political Polarization, Public Opinion, Social Categorization, Survey Data, Social Influence, Attitude Change"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full13","slot_id":"v-full-1513","time_end":"2023-10-26T23:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T22:48:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T22:48:00Z","title":"Polarizing Political Polls: Visualization Design Choices Can Shape Public Opinion and Increase Political Polarization","uid":"v-full-1513","youtube_ff_id":"RmrWjeji25Y","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/RmrWjeji25Y","youtube_prerecorded_id":"_Ux-vx35Iu0","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/_Ux-vx35Iu0"}],"time_start":"2023-10-26T22:00:00Z","title":"Journalism & the Public","track":"oneohnine","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Helen Purchase"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"105","discord_channel_id":"1161741309346861067","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741309346861067","event_prefix":"v-full","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/xEAEsqyKvrs","session_id":"full14","session_image":"full14.png","time_end":"2023-10-25T01:00:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"Large tree structures are ubiquitous and real-world relational datasets often have information associated with nodes (e.g., labels or other attributes) and edges (e.g., weights or distances) that need to be communicated to the viewers. Yet, scalable, easy to read tree layouts are difficult to achieve. We consider tree layouts to be readable if they meet some basic requirements: node labels should not overlap, edges should not cross, edge lengths should be preserved, and the output should be compact. There are many algorithms for drawing trees, although very few take node labels or edge lengths into account, and none optimizes all requirements above. With this in mind, we propose a new scalable method for readable tree layouts. The algorithm guarantees that the layout has no edge crossings and no label overlaps, and optimizing one of the remaining aspects: desired edge lengths and compactness. We evaluate the performance of the new algorithm by comparison with related earlier approaches using several real-world datasets, ranging from a few thousand nodes to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Tree layout algorithms can be used to visualize large general graphs, by extracting a hierarchy of progressively larger trees. We illustrate this functionality by presenting several map-like visualizations generated by the new tree layout algorithm.","authors":["Kathryn Gray","Mingwei Li","Reyan Ahmed","Md.

Our formulation is flexible, exerts limited repulsive forces for nearby nodes and can be adapted separately in its short- and long-range effects.

While icicle trees can map data values faithfully to rectangles of different sizes, often some rectangles are too narrow to be noticed easily. When an icicle tree is transformed into a sunburst tree, the width of each rectangle becomes the length of an annular sector that is usually longer than the original width. While sunburst trees alleviate the problem of narrow rectangles in icicle trees, it no longer maintains the consistency of size encoding. At different tree depths, nodes of the same data values are displayed in annular sections of different sizes in a sunburst tree, though they are represented by rectangles of the same size in an icicle tree. Furthermore, two nodes from different subtrees could sometimes appear as a single node in both icicle trees and sunburst trees. In this paper, we propose a new visual representation, referred to as radial icicle tree (RIT), which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied the new visual design to several datasets. Both the analytical design process and user-centered evaluation have confirmed that this new design has improved the design of icicles and sunburst trees without introducing any relative demerit.","authors":["Yuanzhe Jin","Tim de Jong","Martijn Tennekes","Min Chen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1128/v-full-1128_Preview.mp4?token=GVlEEHnSkLRfg4TVYHSpVl_chlOpjur3ohmAv3QDVZc&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1128/v-full-1128_Preview.vtt?token=gVs3P2T1PgHdm7NV8s7o7YU6CXiuQW8ucQ56-cppiX0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1128/v-full-1128_Presentation.mp4?token=N5PqGO6koh5CV9oNo77mBvXqlv8KRV4E_3pU8IU67lc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1128/v-full-1128_Presentation.vtt?token=MvAUZ8m0DDjKEiFlTuctvKC1xhcsEQlql2af30rNr_Y&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Yuanzhe Jin"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327178","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The Radial Icicle Tree (RIT) elucidates the connections and distinctions between various categories within the dataset.

Among these methods, phrase-based retrieval methods have been proven to capture more concrete and concise information than word-based and paragraph-based methods. However, due to the complex relationship among phrases and a lack of proper visual guidance, achieving user-driven interactive information-seeking and retrieval remains challenging. In this study, we present a visual analytic approach for users to seek information from an extensive collection of documents efficiently. The main component of our approach is a PhraseMap, where nodes and edges represent the extracted keyphrases and their relationships, respectively, from a large corpus. To build the PhraseMap, we extract keyphrases from each document and link the phrases according to word attention determined using modern language models, i.e., BERT. As can be imagined, the graph is complex due to the extensive volume of information and the massive amount of relationships. Therefore, we develop a navigation algorithm to facilitate information seeking. It includes (1) a question-answering (QA) model to identify phrases related to users\u2019 queries and (2) updating relevant phrases based on users\u2019 feedback. To better present the PhraseMap, we introduce a resource-controlled self-organizing map (RC-SOM) to evenly and regularly display phrases on grid cells while expecting phrases with similar semantics to stay close in the visualization. To evaluate our approach, we conducted case studies with three domain experts in diverse literature. The results and feedback demonstrate its effectiveness, usability, and intelligence.","authors":["Yamei Tu","Rui Qiu","Yu-Shuen Wang","Po-Yin Yen","Han-Wei Shen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9964397/v-tvcg-9964397_Preview.mp4?token=BIXpDHgNJEZKaXeHSqJPUe3FhDrmQnWqwSsvmaMuwF4&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9964397/v-tvcg-9964397_Preview.vtt?token=ThUhFMzWtdMmY5BGuznZuKJwUrXTMigyHc476SukZbM&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9964397/v-tvcg-9964397_Presentation.mp4?token=FD8whdZAb33tcalYBMQUCGJVeUZqpy8zdV93lsPh5x8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9964397/v-tvcg-9964397_Presentation.vtt?token=BNNZ7s5r0Tp7_Eu4FbhaLbBhWFGtk13G37wgIz--8dw&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Yamei Tu"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3225114","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9964397","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"In this study, we introduce a visual analytics approach for efficient information retrieval from extensive document collections.

Recent research has taken the performance of benchmark datasets to new heights, especially when these datasets are combined with techniques for machine reading comprehension based on Transformer models. However, as identified through our ongoing collaboration with domain experts and our review of literature, three key challenges limit their further improvement: (i) complex data with multiple long texts, (ii) complex model architecture with multiple modules, and (iii) semantically complex decision process. In this paper, we present VEQA, a visual analytics system that helps experts understand the decision reasons of OpenQA and provides insights into model improvement. The system summarizes the data flow within and between modules in the OpenQA model as the decision process takes place at the summary, instance and candidate levels.

Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to its predefined entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative model. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from an empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative model combined with interactive interface for visualization design.","authors":["Shishi Xiao","Suizi Huang","Yue LIN","Yilin Ye","Wei Zeng"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1292/v-full-1292_Preview.mp4?token=1xAA4AGJDGLcKO4x4QBPwQjMgx3iKkD-7AHtU2wU1eA&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1292/v-full-1292_Preview.vtt?token=OneSG1FiNZlWkuEC5Ai221Ha5IzOoUBKk91Wv0OST4M&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1292/v-full-1292_Presentation.mp4?token=KS_Iwg2Vksa8iW1yc6RuJblhvYOtrzPUl3msLlTyA6I&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1292/v-full-1292_Presentation.vtt?token=8PhffU_LU1smshZVFkR9WA_gLVHVHWeHxP0gl8Qs1zo&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Shishi Xiao"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326913","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"ChartSpark\uff1a An authoring tool encompassing generation and evaluation to create faithful pictorial visualization.","keywords":["pictorial visualization, generative model, authoring tool"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full15","slot_id":"v-full-1292","time_end":"2023-10-25T00:45:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T00:33:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T00:33:00Z","title":"Let the Chart Spark: Embedding Semantic Context into Chart with Generative Model","uid":"v-full-1292","youtube_ff_id":"CiwtQhI1o5E","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/CiwtQhI1o5E","youtube_prerecorded_id":"OXno64ZJhoE","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/OXno64ZJhoE"},{"abstract":"Generative text-to-image models have gained great popularity among the public for their powerful capability to generate high-quality images based on natural language prompts.

The core idea of our approach is to decompose diverse task inputs and outputs into a unified representation (i.e., coordinates and values) and learn a function from coordinates to their corresponding values. We achieve this goal using a residual block-based implicit neural representation architecture with periodic activation functions. We evaluate CoordNet on data generation (i.e., temporal super-resolution and spatial super-resolution) and visualization generation (i.e., view synthesis and ambient occlusion prediction) tasks using time-varying volumetric data sets of various characteristics.

Our method uses existing state-of-the-art SR models and adds flexibility to upscale input data with varying levels of detail across the domain, instead of only uniform grid data that are supported in previous approaches. The key is to use a hierarchy of SR NNs, each trained to perform 2x SR between two levels of detail, with a hierarchical SR algorithm that minimizes seam artifacts by starting from the coarsest level of detail and working up. We show that our hierarchical approach outperforms baseline interpolation and hierarchical upscaling methods, and demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approach across three use cases including data reduction using hierarchical downsampling+SR instead of uniform downsampling+SR, computation savings for hierarchical finite-time Lyapunov exponent field calculation, and super-resolving low-resolution simulation results for a high-resolution approximation visualization.","authors":["Skylar W.

However, state-of-the-art SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality. We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN) and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and transfer functions can be explored.

Experts rely on robust scientific visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from the data. Recent years have shown path tracing to be the preferred approach for volumetric rendering, given its high levels of realism. However, real-time volumetric path tracing often suffers from stochastic noise and long convergence times, limiting interactive exploration. In this paper, we present a novel method to enable real-time global illumination for volume data visualization. We develop Photon Field Networks - a phase-function-aware, multi-light neural representation of indirect volumetric global illumination. The fields are trained on multi-phase photon caches that we compute a priori. Training can be done within seconds, after which the fields can be used in various rendering tasks. To showcase their potential, we develop a custom neural path tracer, with which our photon fields achieve interactive framerates even on large datasets. We conduct in-depth evaluations of the method's performance, including visual quality, stochastic noise, inference and rendering speeds, and accuracy regarding illumination and phase function awareness. Results are compared to ray marching, path tracing and photon mapping. Our findings show that Photon Field Networks can faithfully represent indirect global illumination within the boundaries of the trained phase spectrum while exhibiting less stochastic noise and rendering at a significantly faster rate than traditional methods.","authors":["David Bauer","Qi Wu","Kwan-Liu Ma"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1039/v-full-1039_Preview.mp4?token=65f6F8CzhQSGe3C6kNGUKbiriuKPdWhnkbUrHY_9SrE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1039/v-full-1039_Preview.vtt?token=7DtPeuNa0AYoRUtADAM10_2lU6uL1w8WxqCSpuReR9E&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1039/v-full-1039_Presentation.mp4?token=TW35FC8MCh0qp0Vt668B0xv28MWfNZ9g-6Yfygn86hc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1039/v-full-1039_Presentation.vtt?token=TW1lwuT_8pSOJFPEG9aQ8Cdz0O4kaggdbR41cdoMKsw&expires=1706590800","contributors":["David Bauer"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327107","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Photon Field Networks are implicit neural represenations trained on photon caches traced in volume datasets.

For scientific visualization applications, however, conveying uncertainties of the results to scientists is crucial to avoid generating misleading or incorrect information. In this paper, we propose PSRFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based generative model for scientific data super-resolution that incorporates uncertainty quantification into the super-resolution process. PSRFlow learns the conditional distribution of the high-resolution data based on the low-resolution counterpart. By sampling from a Gaussian latent space that captures the missing information in the high-resolution data, one can generate different plausible super-resolution outputs. The efficient sampling in the Gaussian latent space allows our model to perform uncertainty quantification for the super-resolved results. During model training, we augment the training data with samples across various scales to make the model adaptable to data of different scales, achieving flexible super-resolution for a given input. Our results demonstrate superior performance and robust uncertainty quantification compared with existing methods such as interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution networks.","authors":["JINGYI SHEN","Han-Wei Shen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1215/v-full-1215_Preview.mp4?token=8omjSH3e7hsyzyf0ygC_JVb8hSNkitDWCK-TL7pbuUQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1215/v-full-1215_Preview.vtt?token=BDNV18k2UsLWQvNpzmnClSV33zs0UMKemfrR9HOBKbo&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1215/v-full-1215_Presentation.mp4?token=JRDHAEcbw-3I5ZIYo2NsUoE6mXaq5lcIfgnSbWWvuYw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1215/v-full-1215_Presentation.vtt?token=z7N3H-FITeNGVCRDldMPnpAAZBPJR2oqWyLhntJuD2Y&expires=1706590800","contributors":["JINGYI SHEN"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327171","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We propose PSRFlow, a novel deep learning based super-resolution algorithm with uncertainty quantification.

Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children\u2019s health and aid in the development of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains (e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children\u2019s health status from multi-level perspectives. Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature importance comparison. A set of visualization components is designed for experts to explore and understand multimodal data freely. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of HealthPrism through quantitative evaluation of the model performance, case studies, and expert interviews in associated domains.","authors":["Zhihan Jiang","Handi Chen","Rui Zhou","Jing Deng","Xinchen Zhang","Running Zhao","Cong Xie","Yifang Wang","Edith Ngai"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1290/v-full-1290_Preview.mp4?token=p8sGviIwPO87UJofJQADhBVQDd7gNBadvXDSLA_4SyA&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1290/v-full-1290_Preview.vtt?token=g2pdRah92eQ_4fNn9HsGP4rlNGbvc1hJ76VltZgl3GQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1290/v-full-1290_Presentation.mp4?token=8mfiOPHFvYLfSfe7fV6YSQ7C9CcuaTlFfE87d4rIR7s&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1290/v-full-1290_Presentation.vtt?token=7wzzxXQmcKfs8gOm2jTJlSyrkAddPdEqQNL6J3F0Q0U&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Zhihan Jiang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326943","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The overview of HealthPrism.

Recent studies have shown that the morphology of mitochondria is closely related to the functions of neurons and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the conventional mitochondria analysis workflow mainly relies on manual annotations and generic image-processing software. Moreover, even though there have been recent developments in automatic mitochondria analysis using deep learning, the application of existing methods in a daily analysis remains challenging because the performance of a pretrained deep learning model can vary depending on the target data, and there are always errors in inference time, requiring human proofreading. To address these issues, we introduce MitoVis, a novel visualization system for end-to-end data processing and an interactive analysis of the morphology of neuronal mitochondria. MitoVis introduces a novel active learning framework based on recent contrastive learning, which allows accurate fine-tuning of the neural network model. MitoVis also provides novel visual guides for interactive proofreading so that users can quickly identify and correct errors in the result with minimal effort. We demonstrate the usefulness and efficacy of the system via case studies conducted by neuroscientists. The results show that MitoVis achieved up to 13.3\u00d7 faster total analysis time in the case study compared to the conventional manual analysis workflow.","authors":["JunYoung Choi","Hyun-Jic Oh","Hakjun Lee","Suyeon Kim","Seok-Kyu Kwon","Won-Ki Jeong"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10005035/v-tvcg-10005035_Preview.mp4?token=tF2szkJNMnO7KKwEsRAskT3CwhqMySKDYQoTC2g_7NM&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10005035/v-tvcg-10005035_Preview.vtt?token=X6HLVCN6Ca5WsYs7rk77jDTtkWiTmdgA-lOS0RD1Akw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10005035/v-tvcg-10005035_Presentation.mp4?token=r9nwooBhCUXw5j0Inq6fZZZ47mPMebybFv-cxcwrdLI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10005035/v-tvcg-10005035_Presentation.vtt?token=Z2tDyVyHL8vbI81USvg4Tank2IGTzPCAajK4Cd66MhI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["JunYoung Choi"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3233548","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10005035","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"MitoVis, a unified visual analytics system for end-to-end neuronal mitochondria analysis.","keywords":["Biomedical and medical visualization;intelligence analysis;machine learning;task and requirements analysis;user interfaces"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full17","slot_id":"v-tvcg-10005035","time_end":"2023-10-26T05:33:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T05:21:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T05:21:00Z","title":"MitoVis: A Unified Visual Analytics System for End-to-End Neuronal Mitochondria Analysis","uid":"v-tvcg-10005035","youtube_ff_id":"_h1rsXq9NhU","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/_h1rsXq9NhU","youtube_prerecorded_id":"sjwjvEJ1nwI","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/sjwjvEJ1nwI"},{"abstract":"Genomics researchers increasingly use multiple reference genomes to comprehensively explore genetic variants underlying differences in detectable characteristics between organisms.

However, feedback provided in most SBME is often directed towards improving the operational proficiency of learners, rather than providing summative medical diagnoses that result from experience and time. Additionally, the multimodal nature of medical data during diagnosis poses significant challenges for interns and novice physicians, including the tendency to overlook or over-rely on data from certain modalities, and difficulties in comprehending potential associations between modalities. To address these challenges, we present DiagnosisAssistant, a visual analytics system that leverages historical medical records as a proxy for multimodal modeling and visualization to enhance the learning experience of interns and novice physicians. The system employs elaborately designed visualizations to explore different modality data, offer diagnostic interpretive hints based on the constructed model, and enable comparative analyses of specific patients. Our approach is validated through two case studies and expert interviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing medical training.","authors":["Yang Ouyang","Yuchen Wu","He Wang","Chenyang Zhang","Furui Cheng","Chang Jiang","Lixia Jin","Yuanwu Cao","Quan Li"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1346/v-full-1346_Preview.mp4?token=tUHqgDiJ_7IISRcWzENyqSmoXzXN1WtuWjPRX-AdCys&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1346/v-full-1346_Preview.vtt?token=25xpdkbdj0TjVLMCGPpG5qzHwyEo_n7aeLSuQ1UZSRY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1346/v-full-1346_Presentation.mp4?token=bJXrUnLrLzjC4UHnQKoYsHIRkxQHBBd-FKRR7WddxEk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1346/v-full-1346_Presentation.vtt?token=Yyv4JYDlkvzXTosO7giKR9jSGReiz7KMaavLgYXjPAM&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Yang Ouyang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326929","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The system interface of DiagnosisAssistant contains (A) the User panel, (B) the Embedding Transition View, (C) the Modality Exploration View, and (D) the Comparison View.","keywords":["Multimodal Medical Dataset, Visual Analytics, Explainable Machine Learning"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full17","slot_id":"v-full-1346","time_end":"2023-10-26T05:57:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T05:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T05:45:00Z","title":"Leveraging Historical Medical Records as a Proxy via Multimodal Modeling and Visualization to Enrich Medical Diagnostic Learning","uid":"v-full-1346","youtube_ff_id":"Kpvq91vRi4Q","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/Kpvq91vRi4Q","youtube_prerecorded_id":"RAOZsUGql9E","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/RAOZsUGql9E"}],"time_start":"2023-10-26T04:45:00Z","title":"Medical and Biomedical Applications","track":"oneohfive","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Nan Cao"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"109","discord_channel_id":"1161741434647482379","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741434647482379","event_prefix":"v-full","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/SjlZ-YBpbto","session_id":"full18","session_image":"full18.png","time_end":"2023-10-26T04:15:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"Modern science and industry rely on computational models for simulation, prediction, and data analysis. Spatial blind source separation (SBSS) is a model used to analyze spatial data. Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, it is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, a challenge to its practical use is setting two complex tuning parameters, which requires parameter space analysis. In this paper, we focus on sensitivity analysis (SA). SBSS parameters and outputs are spatial data, which makes SA difficult as few SA approaches in the literature assume such complex data on both sides of the model. Based on the requirements in our design study with statistics experts, we developed a visual analytics prototype for data type agnostic visual sensitivity analysis that fits SBSS and other contexts. The main advantage of our approach is that it requires only dissimilarity measures for parameter settings and outputs. We evaluated the prototype heuristically with visualization experts and through interviews with two SBSS experts. In addition, we show the transferability of our approach by applying it to microclimate simulations. Study participants could confirm suspected and known parameter-output relations, find surprising associations, and identify parameter subspaces to examine in the future.

To address this, current approaches are categorized into feature imputation and label prediction and are primarily focused on handling missing data to enhance ML performance. These approaches rely on the observed data to estimate the missing values and therefore encounter three main shortcomings in imputation, including the need for different imputation methods for various missing data mechanisms, heavy dependence on the assumption of data distribution, and potential introduction of bias. This study proposes a Contrastive Learning (CL) framework to model observed data with missing values, where the ML model learns the similarity between an incomplete sample and its complete counterpart and the dissimilarity between other samples. Our proposed approach demonstrates the advantages of CL without requiring any imputation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce CIVis, a visual analytics system that incorporates interpretable techniques to visualize the learning process and diagnose the model status. Users can leverage their domain knowledge through interactive sampling to identify negative and positive pairs in CL. The output of CIVis is an optimized model that takes specified features and predicts downstream tasks. We provide two usage scenarios in regression and classification tasks and conduct quantitative experiments, expert interviews, and a qualitative user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In short, this study offers a valuable contribution to addressing the challenges associated with ML modeling in the presence of missing data by providing a practical solution that achieves high predictive accuracy and model interpretability.","authors":["Laixin Xie","Yang Ouyang","Longfei Chen","Ziming Wu","Quan Li"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10149378/v-tvcg-10149378_Preview.mp4?token=T8hRkYa2rZBS1-YBPkrMiUrcp14QEzU1HDWWJLIor0A&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10149378/v-tvcg-10149378_Preview.vtt?token=-DXRs30341c-KasnUQWSAx3Zh8wCvJ_DMrZQ1VkqfIU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10149378/v-tvcg-10149378_Presentation.mp4?token=TJBj7JlIuPj0D6iWtBPSBU6JuyLUWN0lfHZLb4SEzos&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10149378/v-tvcg-10149378_Presentation.vtt?token=o-KP0eSi-VELDrA-Uoj9Iz1gp8xc7PkecM94dAyL0FI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Laixin Xie"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3285210","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10149378","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Interaction and observation in CIVis.

Additionally, we conduct a series of evaluation experiments to assess our method from multiple perspectives, including data embedding quality, data restoration accuracy, data encoding capacity, etc. The result of our experiments demonstrates the great potential of InvVis in invertible visualization.","authors":["Huayuan Ye","Chenhui Li","Yang Li","Changbo Wang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1420/v-full-1420_Preview.mp4?token=7Y5sD340CFVh5h073q_dfymGAC-fxpZeCX2kONGb_9Y&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1420/v-full-1420_Preview.vtt?token=WpU8IkTud_INuSpMLFFUqeXO4u0yEt8ygTFEhnLv0F4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1420/v-full-1420_Presentation.mp4?token=auFdI-tZ-Xp3Ao5VN0a347l_oiOpY12bMRSXvVlkpZI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1420/v-full-1420_Presentation.vtt?token=j-4Yi8zMVwYgMceLoyqw9SIiFAWMFfoMxUON4ELWOEM&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Huayuan Ye"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326597","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"InvVis can embed a large amount of data into visualization images, users can decode the embedded data and perform rich exploration, such as redesigning (a) or reconstructing (b) visualizations, rebuilding a visualization dashboard based on the decoded source code and chart data (c), or visualizing volume data based on the decoded raw data and rendering parameters (d).","keywords":["Information visualization, information steganography, invertible visualization, invertible neural network."],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full18","slot_id":"v-full-1420","time_end":"2023-10-26T04:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T04:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T04:00:00Z","title":"InvVis: Large-Scale Data Embedding for Invertible Visualization","uid":"v-full-1420","youtube_ff_id":"O6gAlsCxrWU","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/O6gAlsCxrWU","youtube_prerecorded_id":"SalRGyajgds","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/SalRGyajgds"}],"time_start":"2023-10-26T03:00:00Z","title":"ML for VIS","track":"oneohnine","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Andreas Kerren"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"109","discord_channel_id":"1161741434647482379","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741434647482379","event_prefix":"v-full","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/IH61fsQvTmw","session_id":"full19","session_image":"full19.png","time_end":"2023-10-25T23:15:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"The widespread adoption of Transformers in deep learning, serving as the core framework for numerous large-scale language models, has sparked significant interest in understanding their underlying mechanisms.

We present TransforLearn, the first interactive visual tutorial designed for deep learning beginners and non-experts to comprehensively learn about Transformers. TransforLearn supports interactions for architecture-driven exploration and task-driven exploration, providing insight into different levels of model details and their working processes. It accommodates interactive views of each layer's operation and mathematical formula, helping users to understand the data flow of long text sequences. By altering the current decoder-based recursive prediction results and combining the downstream task abstractions, users can deeply explore model processes. Our user study revealed that the interactions of TransforLearn are positively received.

To inform the design, we first reviewed online examples of animated texts and animated wordles, and summarized strategies for injecting emotion into the animations. We introduced a composite approach that extends an existing animation scheme for one word to multiple words in a wordle with two global factors: the randomness of text animation (entropy) and the animation speed (speed). To create an emordle, general users can choose one predefined animated scheme that matches the intended emotion class and fine-tune the emotion intensity with the two parameters. We designed proof-of-concept emordle examples for four basic emotion classes, namely happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. We conducted two controlled crowdsourcing studies to evaluate our approach. The first study confirmed that people generally agreed on the conveyed emotions from well-crafted animations, and the second one demonstrated that our identified factors helped fine-tune the delivered emotion extent. We also invited general users to create emordles on their own based on our proposed framework. Through this user study, we confirmed the effectiveness of the approach. We concluded with implications for future research opportunities of supporting emotion expression in visualizations.","authors":["Liwenhan Xie","Xinhuan Shu","Jeon Cheol Su","Yun Wang","Siming Chen","Huamin Qu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10153659/v-tvcg-10153659_Preview.mp4?token=3dUPMPXNX7K-O69l35NXw6R5Q5oK_owHYGSShivQy5s&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10153659/v-tvcg-10153659_Preview.vtt?token=ip1OZISYQrbJ9HSsI-lIOMa_JaCSvzres3nud5F0VMI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10153659/v-tvcg-10153659_Presentation.mp4?token=Smg9yovHy0gHBIRC8YGw525o-Q7iUwiXrHZUxDz4X_0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10153659/v-tvcg-10153659_Presentation.vtt?token=3LbmpP-rVKu3IyId5J_daRUgeSPK7Msf8I-1iAl0Myc&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Liwenhan Xie"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3286392","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10153659","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This paper presents an approach to create animated word cloud that matches intended emotion based on a simple kinetic typography.","keywords":["Wordle;Animation;Affective Visualization;Authoring;Casual Visualization"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full19","slot_id":"v-tvcg-10153659","time_end":"2023-10-25T22:24:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T22:12:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T22:12:00Z","title":"Creating Emordle: Animating Word Cloud for Emotion Expression","uid":"v-tvcg-10153659","youtube_ff_id":"W2pP4SHV6kI","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/W2pP4SHV6kI","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"A systematic review (SR) is essential with up-to-date research evidence to support clinical decisions and practices. However, the growing literature volume makes it challenging for SR reviewers and clinicians to discover useful information efficiently. Many human-in-the-loop information retrieval approaches (HIR) have been proposed to rank documents semantically similar to users' queries and provide interactive visualizations to facilitate document retrieval. Given that the queries are mainly composed of keywords and keyphrases retrieving documents that are semantically similar to a query does not necessarily respond to the clinician's need. Clinicians still have to review many documents to find the solution. The problem motivates us to develop a visual analytics system, DocFlow, to facilitate information-seeking. One of the features of our DocFlow is accepting natural language questions. The detailed description enables retrieving documents that can answer users' questions. Additionally, clinicians often categorize documents based on their backgrounds and with different purposes (e.g., populations, treatments). Since the criteria are unknown and cannot be pre-defined in advance, existing methods can only achieve categorization by considering the entire information in documents. In contrast, by locating answers in each document, our DocFlow can intelligently categorize documents based on users' questions. The second feature of our DocFlow is a flexible interface where users can arrange a sequence of questions to customize their rules for document retrieval and categorization. The two features of this visual analytics system support a flexible information-seeking process. The case studies and the feedback from domain experts demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our DocFlow.","authors":["Rui Qiu","Yamei Tu","Yu-Shuen Wang","Po-Yin Yen","Han-Wei Shen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9939115/v-tvcg-9939115_Preview.mp4?token=0TXexBC_zHAbv79HZW-6XuddgTZzs6yl53qIu2y8u5g&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9939115/v-tvcg-9939115_Preview.vtt?token=Eb-P_OHU39Zh4H-SAyemPPRGMsd-EC61CGc76jEsa9I&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9939115/v-tvcg-9939115_Presentation.mp4?token=AkpNpjU5Ef_fzg4BJ60oBfbmJwdwgNeejIKAxI2ie8Q&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9939115/v-tvcg-9939115_Presentation.vtt?token=a75j4BNmfb83bJxHD0oolq0JRmjLrStpS3cUMpEyU_M&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Rui Qiu"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3219762","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9939115","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"We introduce DocFlow, a component-based visual analytics system tailored for nuanced information seeking.

Together with a subsequent dimensionality reduction algorithm, topic models can be used for deriving spatializations for text corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots, reflecting semantic similarity between the documents and supporting corpus analysis. Although the choice of the topic model, the dimensionality reduction, and their underlying hyperparameters significantly impact the resulting layout, it is unknown which particular combinations result in high-quality layouts with respect to accuracy and perception metrics. To investigate the effectiveness of topic models and dimensionality reduction methods for the spatialization of corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots (or basis for landscape-type visualizations), we present a large-scale, benchmark-based computational evaluation. Our evaluation consists of (1) a set of corpora, (2) a set of layout algorithms that are combinations of topic models and dimensionality reductions, and (3) quality metrics for quantifying the resulting layout. The corpora are given as  document-term matrices, and each document is assigned to a thematic class. The chosen metrics quantify the preservation of local and global properties and the perceptual effectiveness of the two-dimensional scatter plots. By evaluating the benchmark on a computing cluster, we derived a multivariate dataset with over 45000 individual layouts and corresponding quality metrics. Based on the results, we propose guidelines for the effective design of text spatializations that are based on topic models and dimensionality reductions. As a main result, we show that interpretable topic models are beneficial for capturing the structure of text corpora. We furthermore recommend the use of t-SNE as a subsequent dimensionality reduction.","authors":["Daniel Atzberger","Tim Cech","Rico Richter","Matthias Trapp","Willy Scheibel","J\u00fcrgen D\u00f6llner","Tobias Schreck"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1510/v-full-1510_Preview.mp4?token=hqSLl0iCL-2FfUozCxfClP6Dm42y9d6VfeWj6a72hFg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1510/v-full-1510_Preview.vtt?token=IiW9jWUz05ap43z214H_le4i1QZ9psEVJ5yIrHYDYdU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1510/v-full-1510_Presentation.mp4?token=U-FpMTEIn4y1sTPr3uZAVApYM4VVptECgZNiSRjqaC4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1510/v-full-1510_Presentation.vtt?token=6CewsmDUBKwzs428d78356VTSFmJuKJbjawyZn8DblE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Daniel Atzberger"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326569","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Two-dimensional layout for the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

Yet different people may vary in their ability to read different visualization types, leading to variance in this ranking across individuals not captured by population-level metrics using \u201caverage observer\u201d models. One way we can bridge this gap is by recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance, in addition to overall visualization performance. In this paper we replicate and extend Cleveland and McGill\u2019s graphical comparison experiment using Bayesian multilevel regression, using these models to explore individual differences in visualization skill from multiple perspectives. The results from experiments and modeling indicate that some people show patterns of accuracy that credibly deviate from the canonical rankings of visualization effectiveness. We discuss implications of these findings, such as a need for new ways to communicate visualization effectiveness to designers, how patterns in individuals\u2019 responses may show systematic biases and strategies in visualization judgment, and how recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance may offer new ways to quantify aspects of visualization literacy.

Black-and-white textures are useful, for instance, as a visual channel for categorical data on low-color displays, in 2D/3D print, to achieve the aesthetic of historic visualizations, or to retain the color hue channel for other visual mappings. We specifically study how to use what we call geometric and iconic textures. Geometric textures use patterns of repeated abstract geometric shapes, while iconic textures use repeated icons that may stand for data categories. We parameterized both types of textures and developed a tool for designers to create textures on simple charts by adjusting texture parameters. 30 visualization experts used our tool and designed 66 textured bar charts, pie charts, and maps. We then had 150 participants rate these designs for aesthetics. Finally, with the top-rated geometric and iconic textures, our perceptual assessment experiment with 150 participants revealed that textured charts perform about equally well as non-textured charts, and that there are some differences depending on the type of chart.","authors":["Tingying He","Yuanyang Zhong","Petra Isenberg","Tobias Isenberg"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1229/v-full-1229_Preview.mp4?token=_r_kbWAp-y4mPaicz9InD2xzoz56bvDZ8tvlq7q2fEY&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1229/v-full-1229_Preview.vtt?token=0_XPY3OaMNRKSKuC-utnkw9FSnEGCx2Iq4xZBDMsNmI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1229/v-full-1229_Presentation.mp4?token=VLmkbq2nu93OYC86bfbHtgVg3jsGgHg_SNFvkZ2hvdw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1229/v-full-1229_Presentation.vtt?token=vMdvlzLYVvtYtEGQ5FolgHgaANJ0Q-NP07djwN2c9us&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Tingying He"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326941","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The bar chart, pie chart designs with geometric and iconic textures with the highest ratings in Experiment 2.","keywords":["Aesthetics, textures, icons, black and white, visualization, visual representations, categorical data, design, perception"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full20","slot_id":"v-full-1229","time_end":"2023-10-26T03:24:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T03:12:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T03:12:00Z","title":"Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization","uid":"v-full-1229","youtube_ff_id":"YSZAgpoddtA","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/YSZAgpoddtA","youtube_prerecorded_id":"5nZ_v7C8xog","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/5nZ_v7C8xog"},{"abstract":"How do people internalize visualizations: as images or information? In this study, we investigate the nature of internalization for visualizations (i.e., how the mind encodes visualizations in memory) and how memory encoding affects its retrieval. This exploratory work examines the influence of various design elements on a user's perception of a chart. Specifically, which design elements lead to perceptions of visualization as an image (aims to provide visual references, evoke emotions, express creativity, and inspire philosophic thought) or as information (aims to present complex data, information, or ideas concisely and promote analytical thinking)? Understanding how design elements contribute to viewers perceiving a visualization more as an image or information will help designers decide which elements to include to achieve their communication goals. For this study, we annotated 500 visualizations and analyzed the responses of 250 online participants, who rated the visualizations on a bilinear scale as 'image' or 'information.' We then conducted an in-person study (n = 101) using a free recall task to examine how the image/information ratings and design elements impacted memory. The results revealed several interesting findings: Image-rated visualizations were perceived as more aesthetically 'appealing,' 'enjoyable,' and 'pleasing.'  Information-rated visualizations were perceived as less 'difficult to understand' and more aesthetically 'likable' and 'nice,' though participants expressed higher 'positive' sentiment when viewing image-rated visualizations and felt less 'guided to a conclusion.' The presence of axes and text annotations heavily influenced the likelihood of participants rating the visualization as 'information.' We also found different patterns among participants that were older. Importantly, we show that visualizations internalized as 'images' are less effective in conveying trends and messages, though they elicit a more positive emotional judgment, while 'informative' visualizations exhibit annotation focused recall and elicit a more positive design judgment. We discuss the implications of this dissociation between aesthetic pleasure and perceived ease of use in visualization design.","authors":["Anjana Arunkumar","Lace M.

However, many questions on the perception of line attributes remain, such as how many levels of attribute variation can be distinguished or which line attributes are the preferred choices for which tasks. We conducted three studies to develop guidelines for using stylized lines to encode scalar data. In our first study, participants drew stylized lines to encode uncertainty information. Uncertainty is usually visualized alongside other data. Therefore, alternative visual channels are important for the visualization of uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty\u2014e.g., in weather forecasts\u2014is a familiar topic to most people. Thus, we picked it for our visualization scenarios in study 1. We used the results of our study to determine the most common line attributes for drawing uncertainty: Dashing, luminance, wave amplitude, and width. While those line attributes were especially common for drawing uncertainty, they are also commonly used in other areas. In studies 2 and 3, we investigated the discriminability of the line attributes determined in study 1. Studies 2 and 3 did not require specific application areas; thus, their results apply to visualizing any scalar data in line attributes. We evaluated the just-noticeable differences (JND) and derived recommendations for perceptually distinct line levels. We found that participants could discriminate considerably more levels for the line attribute width than for wave amplitude, dashing, or luminance.","authors":["Anna Sterzik","Nils Lichtenberg","Jana Wilms","Michael Krone","Douglas Cunningham","Kai Lawonn"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1655/v-full-1655_Preview.mp4?token=q2IG9lmZXbHKyuww-iIc1qWW20xvCEYfrwY1O-16Gj0&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1655/v-full-1655_Preview.vtt?token=--vKQC5GOr4Hmgv_zP59HURrD1CtugS3hR7Ga6q-hxU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1655/v-full-1655_Presentation.mp4?token=bPfnoJi4QIMTCID2Y0BdpFEG4F95sAdoVBhKXFbhZR8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1655/v-full-1655_Presentation.vtt?token=EdT3bmAxWzskKnlhTdUqoqr7l7AFJlqOa4Jfj_H8SkU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Anna Sterzik"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326523","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We investigated the perception of line attributes for visualization.

Recently, the potential of encoding information on surfaces or maps using different densities has also been recognized. This has the significant advantage that additional color can be used as another visual channel and the illustrative textures can then be overlaid. Effectively, it is thus possible to display multiple information, such as two different scalar fields on surfaces simultaneously. In previous work, these textures were manually generated and the choice of density was unempirically determined. Here, we first want to determine and understand the perceptual space of illustrative textures. We chose a succession of simplices with increasing dimensions as primitives for our textures: Dots, lines, and triangles. Thus, we explore the texture types of stippling, hatching, and triangles. We create a range of textures by sampling the density space uniformly. Then, we conduct three perceptual studies in which the participants performed pairwise comparisons for each texture type. We use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to analyze the perceptual spaces per category. The perception of stippling and triangles seems relatively similar. Both are adequately described by a 1D manifold in 2D space. The perceptual space of hatching consists of two main clusters: Crosshatched textures, and textures with only one hatching direction. However, the perception of hatching textures with only one hatching direction is similar to the perception of stippling and triangles. Based on our findings, we construct perceptually uniform illustrative textures. Afterwards, we provide concrete application examples for the constructed textures.","authors":["Anna Sterzik","Monique Meuschke","Douglas Cunningham","Kai Lawonn"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1509/v-full-1509_Preview.mp4?token=Ls5Ykz0G_Xh_M5fu9F87BoVjEDcB_UhRWuV6UqMSuvw&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1509/v-full-1509_Preview.vtt?token=dHuFEvSwEvw95f09zFw2kRouqeBu-3n9cfFEXyhwxt8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1509/v-full-1509_Presentation.mp4?token=qqcXEK2sO-kGYddrrxY9mZcrErv9r6wRA7oMSWSaYJI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1509/v-full-1509_Presentation.vtt?token=819bh5wGgxiKdsb7EXvOdDKri7HMrnpZ-pdWhmxdjvE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Anna Sterzik"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326574","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We studied the perceptual spaces of illustrative textures (stippling, hatching, triangles) and extracted perceptually uniform texture levels by reparameterizing them.

This process also works vice versa such that a mechanical deformation of the material induces an electric field in the EAP device. This specific behaviour makes such materials highly attractive for the construction of actuators and sensors in various application areas. The electromechanical behaviour of electroactive polymers can be described by a third-order coupling tensor which represents the sensitivity of mechanical stresses with respect to the electric field, i.e. it establishes a relation between a second-order and a first-order tensor field. Due to the complexity of this coupling tensor and to the lack of meaningful visualization methods for third-order tensors in general, an interpretation of the tensor is rather difficult. Thus, the central engineering research question that this contribution deals with, is a deeper understanding of the electromechanical coupling by analyzing the third-order coupling tensor with the help of specific visualization methods.

Our technique takes as an input aligned tilt-series from cryogenic electron microscopy and creates denoised 3D tomograms using a proximal jointly-optimized approach that iteratively performs reconstruction and denoising, relieving the users of the need to select appropriate denoising algorithms in the pre-reconstruction or post-reconstruction steps. The whole process is accelerated by exploiting parallelism on modern GPUs, and the results can be visualized immediately after the reconstruction using volume rendering tools incorporated in the framework. We show that our technique can be used with multiple combinations of reconstruction algorithms and regularizers, thanks to the flexibility provided by proximal algorithms. Additionally, the reconstruction framework is open-source and can be easily extended with additional reconstruction and denoising methods. Furthermore, our approach enables visualization of reconstruction error throughout the iterative process within the reconstructed tomogram and on projection planes of the input tilt-series. We evaluate our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches and additionally show how our error visualization can be used for reconstruction evaluation.","authors":["Julio Rey Ramirez,Peter Rautek,Ciril Bohak,Ondrej Strnad,Zheyuan Zhang,Sai Li,Ivan Viola,Wolfgang Heidrich"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9992117/v-tvcg-9992117_Preview.mp4?token=NY7za_0LjEzD6FtLlKY1rI_O3vambzHAMg5ZGujX0yg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9992117/v-tvcg-9992117_Preview.vtt?token=3ydDyoTL-FojH63fZhebx3tvvra3sgDkyIrwogg1ets&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9992117/v-tvcg-9992117_Presentation.mp4?token=xd59kWQt-t87Chsy09appGkxPCl7U-z2u9R_AcsPhuE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9992117/v-tvcg-9992117_Presentation.vtt?token=vWoTPuytvEhZdg6op7dGX29kB9YbXCvmvg-yHkaUaWM&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Julio A Rey Ramirez"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3230445","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9992117","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Left: 3D rendering of a volume obtained with standard cryo-ET reconstruction techniques.

Typically, volume density data are scalars which require simple 1D transfer functions to achieve this mapping. If the volume densities are vectors of three channels, one can straightforwardly map each channel to either red, green or blue, which requires a trivial extension of the 1D transfer function editor. We devise a new method that applies to volume data with more than three channels. These types of data often arise in scientific scanning applications, where the data are separated into spectral bands or chemical elements. Our method expands on prior work in which a multivariate information display, RadViz, was fused with a radial color map, in order to visualize multi-band 2D images. In this work, we extend this joint interface to blended volume rendering. The information display allows users to recognize the presence and value distribution of the multivariate voxels and the joint volume rendering display visualizes their spatial distribution. We design a set of operators and lenses that allow users to interactively control the mapping of the multivariate voxels to opacity and color. This enables users to isolate or emphasize volumetric structures with desired multivariate properties. Furthermore, it turns out that our method also enables more insightful displays even for RGB data. We demonstrate our method with three datasets obtained from spectral electron microscopy, high energy X-ray scanning, and atmospheric science.","authors":["Ayush Kumar","Xinyu Zhang","Huolin L.

Compression techniques have been employed to tackle this challenge, but traditional lossy methods often demand conservative error tolerances to meet the numerical accuracy requirements of both anticipated and unknown data analysis tasks. Progressive data compression and retrieval has emerged as a promising solution, where each analysis task dictates its own accuracy needs. However, few analysis algorithms inherently support progressive data processing, and adapting compression techniques, file formats, client/server frameworks, and APIs to support progressivity can be challenging. This paper presents a framework that enables progressive-precision data queries for any data compressor or numerical representation. Our strategy hinges on a multi-component representation that successively reduces the error between the original and compressed field, allowing each field in the progressive sequence to be expressed as a partial sum of components. We have implemented this approach with four established scientific data compressors and assessed its effectiveness using real-world data sets from the SDRBench collection. The results show that our framework competes in accuracy with the standalone compressors it is based upon. Additionally, (de)compression time is proportional to the number of components requested by the user. Finally, our framework allows for fully lossless compression using lossy compressors when a sufficient number of components are employed.","authors":["Victor A. P.

However, manually adjusting the transfer function to achieve the desired DVR result can be time-consuming and unintuitive. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Design Galleries, an image-based transfer function design approach to help users explore the design space of transfer functions by taking advantage of the recent advances in deep learning and differentiable rendering. Specifically, we leverage neural rendering to learn a latent design space, which is a continuous manifold representing various types of implicit transfer functions. We further provide a set of interactive tools to support intuitive query, navigation, and modification to obtain the target design, which is represented as a neural-rendered design exemplar. The explicit transfer function can be reconstructed from the target design with a differentiable direct volume renderer.

Octree approaches work by performing hierarchical tree traversal. However, in octree volume rendering, tree traversal and the selection of data resolution are intrinsically coupled. This makes fine-grained empty-space skipping costly. Page tables, on the other hand, allow access to any cached brick from any resolution. However, they do not offer a clear and efficient strategy for substituting missing high-resolution data with lower-resolution data. We enable flexible mixed-resolution out-of-core multi-volume rendering by decoupling the cache residency of multi-resolution data from a resolution-independent spatial subdivision determined by the tree. Instead of one-to-one node-to-brick correspondences, each residency octree node is mapped to a set of bricks from different resolution levels. This makes it possible to efficiently and adaptively choose and mix resolutions, adapt sampling rates, and compensate for cache misses. At the same time, residency octrees support fine-grained empty-space skipping, independent of the data subdivision used for caching. Finally, to facilitate collaboration and outreach, and to eliminate local data storage, our implementation is a web-based, pure client-side renderer using WebGPU and WebAssembly. Our method is faster than prior approaches and efficient for many data channels with a flexible and adaptive choice of data resolution.","authors":["Lukas Herzberger","Markus Hadwiger","Robert Kr\u00fcger","Peter Sorger","Hanspeter Pfister","Eduard Gr\u00f6ller","Johanna Beyer"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1202/v-full-1202_Preview.mp4?token=Z6u7TPe-Pck6A8vi041zrR9yWSBZknaFUL81y-9C-BM&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1202/v-full-1202_Preview.vtt?token=zX6CW_AaqtZAvS6ahzfj266HW7k67YkrcypekNm7WDU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1202/v-full-1202_Presentation.mp4?token=qZe3HdGhOsbUOkIP38Vi1_6WI_87zisZTeuK_QGmze8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1202/v-full-1202_Presentation.vtt?token=TvsQxAcTmo5ZjF7c6NmggaqF0LkwACJ4yWTd4EZzbsg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Lukas Herzberger"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327193","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"In contrast to octree-based out-of-core approaches (left) which employ a one-to-one mapping between octree nodes and bricks, the residency octree nodes in our approach (right) represent geometric spatial regions, with each node mapping to multiple bricks and vice versa.

To pursue this goal, it is necessary to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods that simultaneously perceive the 3D environment, reason about physical tasks, and model the performer, all in real-time. Within this framework, a wide variety of sensors are needed to generate data across different modalities, such as audio, video, depth, speech, and time-of-flight. The required sensors are typically part of the AR headset, providing performer sensing and interaction through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. AI assistants not only record the performer as they perform activities, but also require machine learning (ML) models to understand and assist the performer as they interact with the physical world. Therefore, developing such assistants is a challenging task. We propose ARGUS, a visual analytics system to support the development of intelligent AR assistants. Our system was designed as part of a multi-year-long collaboration between visualization researchers and ML and AR experts. This co-design process has led to advances in the visualization of ML in AR. Our system allows for online visualization of object, action, and step detection as well as offline analysis of previously recorded AR sessions. It visualizes not only the multimodal sensor data streams but also the output of the ML models.

Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world. We conclude by discussing future research directions that will help establish a complete understanding of the design of situated visualization, including the role of interactivity, tasks, and workflows.","authors":["Benjamin Lee","Michael Sedlmair","Dieter Schmalstieg"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1297/v-full-1297_Preview.mp4?token=sur-FajtBEsOEf5Y2nnpxpUSAfDh84r7sNfMLeu-D-o&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1297/v-full-1297_Preview.vtt?token=51kzP_4WytzwcVv0mdJqBZ9TDI0t9Cj6zICTWgYTXNQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1297/v-full-1297_Presentation.mp4?token=8Eo_56pHdmPvQ8iU-VB5noGNqasdtRVKmaRZa9SFLIo&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1297/v-full-1297_Presentation.vtt?token=Xl2ievsORIPl-eoFa_Lqd9SZ3JZy0Qo9hyzmGA7QhkQ&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Benjamin Lee"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327398","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We present 10 design patterns for visualising data in the context of physical referents.

Ensuring the readability of AR labels requires placing them occlusion-free manner while keeping visual linkings legible, especially when multiple labels exist in the scene. Although existing optimization-based methods, such as force-based methods, are effective in managing AR labels in static scenarios, they often struggle in dynamic scenarios with constantly moving objects. This is due to their focus on generating layouts optimal for the current moment, neglecting future moments and leading to sub-optimal or unstable layouts over time. In this work, we present RL-LABEL, a deep reinforcement learning-based method intended for managing the placement of AR labels in scenarios involving moving objects. RL-LABEL considers both the current and predicted future states of objects and labels, such as positions and velocities, as well as the user\u2019s viewpoint, to make informed decisions about label placement. It balances the trade-offs between immediate and long-term objectives. We tested RL-LABEL in simulated AR scenarios on two real-world datasets, showing that it effectively learns the decision-making process for long-term optimization, outperforming two baselines (i.e., no view management and a force-based method) by minimizing label occlusions, line intersections, and label movement distance. Additionally, a user study involving 18 participants indicates that, within our simulated environment, RL-LABEL excels over the baselines in aiding users to identify, compare, and summarize data on labels in dynamic scenes.","authors":["Zhutian Chen","Daniele Chiappalupi","Tica Lin","Yalong Yang","Johanna Beyer","Hanspeter Pfister"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1532/v-full-1532_Preview.mp4?token=9BsfuTihhnlVaE0NtcsHZ8azAF5pt5LsHxRmJ-jbGP8&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1532/v-full-1532_Preview.vtt?token=15rQPFN3_u7CopxyEfPylfV8tu7NrcS7CfUdK9KT7Qw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Zhutian Chen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326568","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"RL-LABEL not only adapts label placement considering players\u2019 current motion status (e.g., speed, direction) and long-term outcomes but also ensures label stability over time.

The spatial layout of fire stations is closely linked to the efficiency of fire rescue operations. Traditional approaches have primarily relied on mathematical planning models to generate appropriate layouts by summarizing relevant evaluation criteria. However, this optimization process presents significant challenges due to the extensive decision space, inherent conflicts among criteria, and decision-makers' preferences. To address these challenges, we propose FSLens, an interactive visual analytics system that enables in-depth evaluation and rational optimization of fire station layout. Our approach integrates fire records and correlation features to reveal fire occurrence patterns and influencing factors using spatiotemporal sequence forecasting. We design an interactive visualization method to explore areas within the city that are potentially under-resourced for fire service based on the fire distribution and existing fire station layout. Moreover, we develop a collaborative human-computer multi-criteria decision model that generates multiple candidate solutions for optimizing firefighting resources within these areas. We simulate and compare the impact of different solutions on the original layout through well-designed visualizations, providing decision-makers with the most satisfactory solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through one case study with real-world datasets.

The accelerated progression of global warming has amplified their frequency and scale, deepening their impact on human life, the economy, and the environment. The temperature rise has been driving wildfires to behave unpredictably compared to those previously observed, challenging researchers and fire management agencies to understand the factors behind this behavioral change. Furthermore, this change has rendered fire personnel training outdated and lost its ability to adequately prepare personnel to respond to these new fires. Immersive visualization can play a key role in tackling the growing issue of wildfires. Therefore, this survey reviews various studies that use immersive and non-immersive data visualization techniques to depict wildfire behavior and train first responders and planners. This paper identifies the most useful characteristics of these systems.

To win a match, coaches must consider various factors and select appropriate players for a planned formation. Computation-based tools have been proposed to help coaches on this complex task, but they are usually based on over-simplified models on player performances, do not support interactive analysis, and overlook the inputs by coaches. In this paper, we propose a method for visual analytics of soccer lineup selection by tackling two challenges: characterizing essential factors involved in generating optimal lineup, and supporting coach-driven visual analytics of lineup selection. We develop a lineup selection model that integrates such important factors, such as spatial regions of player actions and defensive interactions with opponent players. A visualization system, Team-Builder, is developed to help coaches control the process of lineup generation, explanation, and comparison through multiple coordinated views. The usefulness and effectiveness of our system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world soccer event dataset.","authors":["Anqi Cao","Ji Lan","Xiao Xie","Hongyu Chen","Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang","Hui Zhang","Yingcai Wu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9894103/v-tvcg-9894103_Preview.mp4?token=e19UJYO3XXavAV6nTNKVAM6_FquxtytfwiB1IBU0gNQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9894103/v-tvcg-9894103_Preview.vtt?token=rtZjJasfiYFc0C5TVcXMpWx1XtVMeIaCzrhbHAMltis&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9894103/v-tvcg-9894103_Presentation.mp4?token=C83dz4Cv_ZNexqr5FJDsyh5PSG9qQljq54msIV3uH-g&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9894103/v-tvcg-9894103_Presentation.vtt?token=aTpb7G8Z_mzHYmR3Of3GSl6I4XE0w0kAzR1uKTDdNJ8&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Anqi Cao"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3207147","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9894103","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"System user interface.

However, previous studies on action evaluation only provide a score for each action, and hardly support inspecting and comparing player actions integrated with complex match context information such as team tactics and player locations. In this work, we collaborate with soccer analysts and coaches to characterize the domain problems of evaluating player performance based on action scores. We design a tailored visualization of soccer player actions that places the action choice together with the tactic it belongs to as well as the player locations in the same view. Based on the design, we introduce a visual analytics system, Action-Evaluator, to facilitate a comprehensive player action evaluation through player navigation, action investigation, and action explanation. With the system, analysts can find players to be analyzed efficiently, learn how they performed under various match situations, and obtain valuable insights to improve their action choices.

While common wisdom suggests that recontextualizing visualizations with metadata (e.g., disclosing the data source or instructions for decoding the visualizations' encoding) may counter these effects, the impact remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, we explored how chart type, topic, and user goal impacted which categories of metadata participants deemed most relevant. We presented 64 participants with four real-world visualizations. For each visualization, participants were given four goals and selected the type of metadata they most wanted from a set of 18 types. Our results indicated that participants were most interested in metadata which explained the visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding and metadata about the source of the data for assessing trustworthiness. In Experiment 2, we explored how these two types of metadata impact transparency, trustworthiness and persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding. We asked 144 participants to explain the main message of two pairs of visualizations (one with metadata and one without); rate them on scales of transparency and relevance; and then predict the likelihood that they were selected for a presentation to policymakers. Our results suggested that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough than those without metadata, but similarly relevant, accurate, clear, and complete. Additionally, we found that metadata did not impact the accuracy of the information extracted from visualizations, but may have influenced which information participants remembered as important or interesting.","authors":["Alyxander Burns","Christiana Lee","Thai On","Cindy Xiong Bearfield","Evan Peck","Narges Mahyar"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9998319/v-tvcg-9998319_Preview.mp4?token=8yul5Pk5NBky4RYdgbDBQt3rTt5pfHbc6_ChI4f1Qog&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9998319/v-tvcg-9998319_Preview.vtt?token=vcCgYaATCqjBBeZW1m39FHVdT5OAAHExy3bJsF3eL9I&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9998319/v-tvcg-9998319_Presentation.mp4?token=V2P-LYdw1dJr3kkhiLJnqZbXTRM_p834B8TpcMWynYE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9998319/v-tvcg-9998319_Presentation.vtt?token=H0Sew5PGJIKXf-fFmX_ipXYuwEvkaFWOvINV3Qnhjrg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Alyxander Burns"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3231716","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9998319","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"In this paper, we explore what kinds of metadata people want and the impacts of having access to metadata on experience and understanding.

This intention can be of many forms such as to persuade, to educate, to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to expressing their intention, the story plot must balance being consumable and enjoyable while preserving scientific integrity. In data stories, numerous methods have been identified for constructing and presenting a plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand how we think and create the visual elements that present the story. Stories are brought to life by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, enjoyable, memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through the analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of \u201ccharacter-oriented design\u201d. We identify the roles and visual representations data characters assume as well as the types of relationships these roles have with one another. We identify characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify their visual representations. We then illustrate \u201ccharacter-oriented design\u201d by showing how to develop data characters with common data story plots. With this work, we present a framework for data characters derived from our analysis; we then offer our extension to the data storytelling process using character-oriented design.

Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player\u2019s efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones.","authors":["Leixian Shen","yizhi zhang","Haidong Zhang","Yun Wang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1049/v-full-1049_Preview.mp4?token=s6LRQKH6ZgIriQ-e1vYm1XD_wwWaTttB6A96oT7BfbI&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1049/v-full-1049_Preview.vtt?token=8-QjRK7I0qF-zSopQON22UoewIUQUOggWp4acu5xQrg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1049/v-full-1049_Presentation.mp4?token=AwEWb-BKR5IEC1pM85tVppe9iPDc_vuCbYXWWc4dlQc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1049/v-full-1049_Presentation.vtt?token=TPAPJ1IfIEtT2ldONE_U-_JNmhnYb1BV5HbaHH1eYwE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Leixian Shen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327197","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The pipeline of automatic generation of data videos with narration-animation interplay.","keywords":["Visualization, Narration-animation interplay, Data video, Human-AI collaboration"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full24","slot_id":"v-full-1049","time_end":"2023-10-24T22:48:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-24T22:36:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-24T22:36:00Z","title":"Data Player: Automatic Generation of Data Videos with Narration-Animation Interplay","uid":"v-full-1049","youtube_ff_id":"WkHHY7haJYI","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/WkHHY7haJYI","youtube_prerecorded_id":"wrtAbOrr3m8","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/wrtAbOrr3m8"},{"abstract":"Recent work has shown that when both the chart and caption emphasize the same aspects of the data, readers tend to remember the doubly-emphasized features as takeaways; when there is a mismatch, readers rely on the chart to form takeaways and can miss information in the caption text. Through a survey of 280 chart-caption pairs in real-world sources (e.g., news media, poll reports, government reports, academic articles, and Tableau Public), we find that captions often do not emphasize the same information in practice, which could limit how effectively readers take away the authors\u2019 intended messages. Motivated by the survey findings, we present EmphasisChecker, an interactive tool that highlights visually prominent chart features as well as the features emphasized by the caption text along with any mismatches in the emphasis.

Existing automated data storytelling system, however, tends to overlook the importance of user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work.","authors":["Guande Wu","Shunan Guo","Jane Hoffswell","Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan","Ryan Rossi","Eunyee Koh"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1311/v-full-1311_Preview.mp4?token=IGaqF7Tr1GewqngmBBs_x6SU0j5w5-woKZQ-5YsbNGc&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1311/v-full-1311_Preview.vtt?token=VtjmiCsCgG11CMO7TevzOdNTgflCq3ATc2V8rkxrdAw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1311/v-full-1311_Presentation.mp4?token=SACQiHRO-2_RGs1xS8qgnoCnTaQsPj5YDIojzTHvi-g&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1311/v-full-1311_Presentation.vtt?token=SSmrrNScnYKKjQyAijS_AnlvfJF89TVVPnGtlpiEfWk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Guande Wu"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327363","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Socrates: Data Story Generation via Adaptive Machine-Guided Elicitation of User Feedback.

As such the derived static causal networks do not take into account the effect of time as an indicator. However, knowing the time delay of a causal relation can be crucial as it instructs how and when actions should be taken. Yet, similar to static causality, deriving causal relations from observational time-series data, as opposed to designed experiments, is not a straightforward process. It can greatly benefit from human insight to break ties and resolve errors.  We hence propose a set of visual analytics methods that allow humans to participate in the discovery of causal relations associated with windows of time delay. Specifically, we leverage a well-established method, logic-based causality, to enable analysts to test the significance of potential causes and measure their influences toward a certain effect. Furthermore, since an effect can be a cause of other effects, we allow users to  aggregate different temporal cause-effect relations found with our method into a visual flow diagram to enable the discovery of temporal causal networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods we constructed a prototype system named DOMINO and showcase it via a number of case studies using real-world datasets. Finally, we also used DOMINO to conduct several evaluations with human analysts from different science domains in order to gain feedback on the utility of our system in practical scenarios.","authors":["Jun Wang","Klaus Mueller"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9895311/v-tvcg-9895311_Preview.mp4?token=46BfoX7m-QlN9PMbXCN4Gfl-wUkET2Ond3cm-eSfdlg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9895311/v-tvcg-9895311_Preview.vtt?token=CG4s5D1h0YlQSHBg5gLwW_Y-CVa6nUsIU9bFXsZ2oD4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9895311/v-tvcg-9895311_Presentation.mp4?token=5tr8MrVeZYXtIeav9_s_oVu2a4K_nT6kWaMVmePREi4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9895311/v-tvcg-9895311_Presentation.vtt?token=cWt_7Vl0xCVEPokWh32yqohH0s2o1LjnUoYFws1yQSM&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Klaus Mueller"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3207929","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9895311","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"The visual interface of our DOMINO system.

Visualizing these simulations is problematic because these datasets often contain millions, if not billions of particles carrying physical attributes and moving over time. Radial basis functions (RBFs) are used to model particles, and overlapping particles are interpolated to reconstruct a high-quality volumetric field; however, this interpolation process is expensive and makes interactive visualization difficult. Existing RBF interpolation schemes do not account for color-mapped attributes and are instead constrained to visualizing just the density field. To address these challenges, we exploit ray tracing cores in modern GPU architectures to accelerate scalar field reconstruction. We use a novel RBF interpolation scheme to integrate per-particle colors and densities, and leverage GPU-parallel tree construction and refitting to quickly update the tree as the simulation animates over time or when the user manipulates particle radii. We also propose a Hilbert reordering scheme to cluster particles together at the leaves of the tree to reduce tree memory consumption. Finally, we reduce the noise of volumetric shadows by adopting a spatially temporal blue noise sampling scheme. Our method can provide a more detailed and interactive view of these large, volumetric, time-series particle datasets than traditional methods, leading to new insights into these physics simulations.","authors":["Nate Morrical","Stefan Zellmann","Alper Sahistan","Patrick Shriwise","Valerio Pascucci"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1079/v-full-1079_Preview.mp4?token=Hg1jRebFBXm6jjBnce4X0fia-nq__YlWvuDlm2WJm0w&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1079/v-full-1079_Preview.vtt?token=60OjyN6o9w7znpHlGGwkzQ_39P_jsgz4rIqZbsF6A04&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1079/v-full-1079_Presentation.mp4?token=R8nec98H0TUFqq_szbDEVKLF3UAsxTC5poH4oPGEcrI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1079/v-full-1079_Presentation.vtt?token=Krh5qe9w6-v1zy114efAg8uSZMErwdJQCYAJxx4bVb8&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Nate Morrical"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327366","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The \"Cabana Dam Break\" data set, rendered interactively with our method at 46 FPS, 4-samples-per-pixel per-frame with volumetric shadows (left is 1 frame, right is 1024 averaged frames, bottom row are progressing time steps).

It focuses on four main tasks commonly employed in the analysis of time-series and large value ranges visualization: identification, discrimination, estimation, and trend detection. For each task we analyze error, confidence, and response time. The new order of magnitude horizon graph performs better or equal to all other designs in identification, discrimination, and estimation tasks.

However, for users who lack visual analysis expertise, interpreting and manipulating EVA can be challenging. Thus, providing guidance on EVA is necessary and two relevant questions need to be answered. First, how to recommend interesting insights to provide a first glance at data and help develop an exploration goal. Second, how to provide step-by-step EVA suggestions to help identify which parts of the data to explore. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system, Visail, which generates EVA sequences to guide the exploration of time series data. As a user uploads a time series dataset, Visail can generate step-by-step EVA suggestions, while each step is visualized as an annotated chart combined with textual descriptions. The RL-based algorithm uses exploratory data analysis knowledge to construct the state and action spaces for the agent to imitate human analysis behaviors in data exploration tasks. In this way, the agent learns the strategy of generating coherent EVA sequences through a well-designed network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted an ablation study, a user study, and two case studies.

Recent studies have shown that the DL success is often attributed to effective data representations, fostering the fields of feature engineering and representation learning. However, automated approaches for feature learning are typically limited with respect to incorporating prior knowledge, identifying interactions among variables, and choosing evaluation metrics to ensure that the models are reliable. To improve on these limitations, this paper contributes a novel visual analytics framework, namely TimeTuner, designed to help analysts understand how model behaviors are associated with localized correlations, stationarity, and granularity of time-series representations. The system mainly consists of the following two-stage technique: We first leverage counterfactual explanations to connect the relationships among time-series representations, multivariate features and model predictions. Next, we design multiple coordinated views including a partition-based correlation matrix and juxtaposed bivariate stripes, and provide a set of interactions that allow users to step into the transformation selection process, navigate through the feature space, and reason the model performance. We instantiate TimeTuner with two transformation methods of smoothing and sampling, and demonstrate its applicability on real-world time-series forecasting of univariate sunspots and multivariate air pollutants.

ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in-depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large-scale ST series in an evolution pattern-aware and narrative-preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two-level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis.","authors":["Zikun Deng","Shifu Chen","Tobias Schreck","Dazhen Deng","Tan Tang","Mingliang Xu","Di Weng","Yingcai Wu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1179/v-full-1179_Preview.mp4?token=93xWbNFB5tBu7iB23HqNHUl46wTsitWKvptKGn--oak&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1179/v-full-1179_Preview.vtt?token=M3pepyuiohpc7XJ5djnZedxkvyYLt_Y4U-ItyJOYxto&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1179/v-full-1179_Presentation.mp4?token=EHzvTaIaXwMhzbz4-7EiyCTQxP-qoVei1NsEWypmy3w&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1179/v-full-1179_Presentation.vtt?token=jPovC_-QWOeIfS0kxmSPF55tjfjFNu1v1cyyQXR_DqY&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Zikun Deng"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327162","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"A novel Storyline-based visualization is proposed to visualizing large-scale spatial time series.

Our work revisits the seminal algorithm \"PairSimplices\" [31], [103] with discrete Morse theory (DMT) [34], [80], which greatly reduces the number of input simplices to consider. Further, we also extend to DMT and accelerate the stratification strategy described in \"PairSimplices\" for the fast computation of the 0th and (d - 1)th diagrams, noted $D_0(f)$ and $D_{d-1}(f)$. Minima-saddle persistence pairs ($D_0(f)$) and saddle-maximum persistence pairs ($D_{d-1}(f)$) are efficiently computed by processing, with a Union-Find, the unstable sets of 1-saddles and the stable sets of (d - 1)-saddles. This fast pre-computation for the dimensions 0 and (d - 1) enables an aggressive specialization of [4] to the 3D case, which results in a drastic reduction of the number of input simplices for the computation of $D_1(f)$, the intermediate layer of the sandwich. Finally, we document several performance improvements via shared-memory parallelism. We provide an open-source implementation of our algorithm for reproducibility purposes. We also contribute a reproducible benchmark package, which exploits three-dimensional data from a public repository and compares our algorithm to a variety of publicly available implementations. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm improves by two orders of magnitude the time performance of the seminal \"PairSimplices\" algorithm it extends. Moreover, it also improves memory footprint and time performance over a selection of 14 competing approaches, with a substantial gain over the fastest available approaches, while producing a strictly identical output.","authors":["Pierre Guillou","Jules Vidal","Julien Tierny"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10021892/v-tvcg-10021892_Preview.mp4?token=LunNmPPQlZnDDUvtOm2Sk5NpCma8YeChXvdRWpkXxe0&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10021892/v-tvcg-10021892_Preview.vtt?token=Xf_0nLAn-XTCgbPKO9mhbM6Z0lmJ5NMH2ytBmh7tAts&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10021892/v-tvcg-10021892_Presentation.mp4?token=vZlPAyka-_TUAtz8vgQqPSznvEpM6-J-asrN6uxTW4o&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10021892/v-tvcg-10021892_Presentation.vtt?token=N6mI2UXydk47dJUGfUpfI2LCi67HaWWuLd5JS5QlWl0&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Julien Tierny"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3238008","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10021892","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This work presents a fast algorithm for the computation of persistence diagrams.

We introduce an efficient, iterative algorithm which exploits shared-memory parallelism, as well as an analytic expression of the fitting energy gradient, to ensure fast iterations. Our approach also trivially extends to extremum persistence diagrams. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our approach - with MT-PGA computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples.

First, we apply MT-PGA to data reduction and reliably compress merge trees by concisely representing them by their first coordinates in the MT-PGA basis. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction framework exploiting the first two directions of the MT-PGA basis to generate two-dimensional layouts of the ensemble. We augment these layouts with persistence correlation views, enabling global and local visual inspections of the feature variability in the ensemble.

Color maps, however, do not explicitly convey structures (e.g., positions and scale of features) within data. Topology-based visualizations reveal and explicitly communicate structures underlying data. Although our understanding of what types of features are captured by topological visualizations is good, our understanding of people's perception of those features is not. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of topology-based isocontour, Reeb graph, and persistence diagram visualizations compared to a reference color map visualization for synthetically generated scalar fields on 2-manifold triangular meshes embedded in 3D. In particular, we built and ran a human-subject study that evaluated the perception of data features characterized by Gaussian signals and measured how effectively each visualization technique portrays variations of data features arising from the position and amplitude variation of a mixture of Gaussians. For positional feature variations, the results showed that only the Reeb graph visualization had high sensitivity. For amplitude feature variations, persistence diagrams and color maps demonstrated the highest sensitivity, whereas isocontours showed only weak sensitivity. These results take an important step toward understanding which topology-based tools are best for various data and task scenarios and their effectiveness in conveying topological variations as compared to conventional color mapping.","authors":["Tushar M.

This paper describes the ExTreeM-Algorithm: a scalable algorithm for the computation of merge trees via extremum graphs. The core idea of ExTreeM is to first derive the extremum graph G of an input scalar field f defined on a cell complex K, and subsequently compute the unaugmented merge tree of f on G instead of K; which are equivalent. Any merge tree algorithm can be carried out significantly faster on G, since K in general contains substantially more cells than G. To further speed up computation, ExTreeM includes a tailored procedure to derive merge trees of extremum graphs. The computation of the fully augmented merge tree, i.e., a merge tree domain segmentation of K, can then be performed in an optional post processing step. All steps of ExTreeM consist of procedures with high parallel efficiency, and we provide a formal proof of its correctness.

Effectively, we are able to leverage the reduced susceptibility of path mappings to small perturbations in the data when compared with the original Wasserstein distance. Our approach therefore exhibits superior performance and quality in typical tasks such as ensemble summarization, ensemble clustering, and temporal reduction of time series, while retaining practically feasible runtimes.

Realistically and efficiently detecting and tracking TCs are critical for assessing their impacts and risks. In particular, the eye is a signature feature of a mature TC. Therefore, knowing the eyes' locations and movements is crucial for both operational weather forecasts and climate risk assessments. Recently, a multilevel robustness framework has been introduced to study the critical points of time-varying vector fields. The framework quantifies the robustness (i.e., structural stability) of critical points across varying neighborhoods. By relating the multilevel robustness with critical point tracking, the framework has demonstrated its potential in cyclone tracking. An advantage is that it identifies cyclonic features using only 2D wind vector fields, which is encouraging as most tracking algorithms require multiple dynamic and thermodynamic variables at different altitudes. A disadvantage is that the framework does not scale well computationally for datasets containing a large number of cyclones.  This paper introduces a topologically robust physics-informed tracking framework (TROPHY) for TC tracking. The main idea is to integrate physical knowledge of TC to drastically improve the computational efficiency of multilevel robustness framework for large-scale climate datasets. First, during preprocessing, we propose a physics-informed feature selection strategy to filter 90% of critical points that are short-lived and have low stability, thus preserving good candidates for TC tracking. Second, during in-processing, we impose constraints during the multilevel robustness computation to focus only on physics-informed neighborhoods of TCs. We apply TROPHY to 30 years of 2D wind fields from reanalysis data in ERA5 and generate a number of TC tracks. In comparison with the observed tracks, we demonstrate that TROPHY can capture TC characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, duration, latitudes with maximum intensity, and genesis) that are comparable to and sometimes even better than a well-validated TC tracking algorithm that requires multiple dynamic and thermodynamic scalar fields.","authors":["Lin Yan","Hanqi Guo","Tom Peterka","Bei Wang Phillips","Jiali Wang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1609/v-full-1609_Preview.mp4?token=Rc2F_FsreO2cgYcxyb39IawCFOOid1muWQ6Wc6hBbbs&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1609/v-full-1609_Preview.vtt?token=BrlcCLK4iu3JBx2ijuEYtLDOvV1WBqFHVEEnhNihFAE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1609/v-full-1609_Presentation.mp4?token=NaZUdJOvR38U4CUBo0A4f3EHDgY96A17kN-a6KVrw0k&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1609/v-full-1609_Presentation.vtt?token=RXWMIlosb-vu67ylWeqhu9hS6kHVIr1thLNlzZlQFmE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Tom Peterka"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326905","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Tropical cyclones are among the most destructive weather systems.

Our work is motivated by the analysis of image data acquired using micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) of ancient, rolled and folded thin-layer structures such as papyrus, parchment, and paper as well as silver and lead sheets. From these documents we know that they are 2-dimensional (2D) in nature. Hence, we are particularly interested in reconstructing 2D manifolds that approximate the document\u2019s structure. The image data from which we want to reconstruct the 2D manifolds are often very noisy and represent folded, densely-layered structures with many artifacts, such as ruptures or layer splitting and merging. Previous ridge-surface extraction methods fail to extract the desired 2D manifold for such challenging data. We have therefore developed a novel method to extract 2D manifolds. The proposed method uses a local fast marching scheme in combination with a separation of the region covered by fast marching into two sub-regions. The 2D manifold of interest is then extracted as the surface separating the two sub-regions. The local scheme can be applied for both automatic propagation as well as interactive analysis. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of our method on both artificial data as well as real-world data including folded silver and papyrus sheets.","authors":["Nicolas Klenert","Verena Lepper","Daniel Baum"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1295/v-full-1295_Preview.mp4?token=Lsr1w4T2s0vmyMIRf97D2lg0ApE2Aqw7MHxQ3avsWFQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1295/v-full-1295_Preview.vtt?token=l6joYjcg3OrGSbMx8l_-upBwIu19OgzGrv65fD9xjHg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1295/v-full-1295_Presentation.mp4?token=Zka0wDqQfRj9hssEX7uRVIn6SdonJ1RuwHlEm9IJpZ0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1295/v-full-1295_Presentation.vtt?token=2dYQm6-2mERGLCFBwPAtIkFZwX8nzETba4dGVP--9IU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Nicolas Klenert"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327403","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Volume Rendering of a silver sheet package, blended together with surfaces created by the proposed algorithm.

Due to the irregular nature of these data, computing connectivity information between the mesh elements requires much more time and memory than on uniformly distributed data. To lower storage costs, dynamic data structures have been proposed. These data structures compute connectivity information on the fly and discard them when no longer needed. However, on-the-fly computation slows down algorithms and results in a negative impact on the time performance. To address this issue, we propose a new task-parallel approach to proactively compute mesh connectivity. Unlike previous approaches implementing data-parallel models, where all threads run the same type of instructions, our task-parallel approach allows threads to run different functions. Specifically, some threads run the algorithm of choice while other threads compute connectivity information before they are actually needed. The approach was implemented in the new Accelerated Clustered TOPOlogical (ACTOPO) data structure, which can support any processing algorithm requiring mesh connectivity information. Our experiments show that ACTOPO combines the benefits of state-of-the-art memory-efficient (TTK CompactTriangulation) and time-efficient (TTK ExplicitTriangulation) topological data structures. It occupies a similar amount of memory as TTK CompactTriangulation while providing up to 5x speedup. Moreover, it achieves comparable time performance as TTK ExplicitTriangulation while using only half of the memory space.","authors":["Guoxi Liu","Federico Iuricich"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1222/v-full-1222_Preview.mp4?token=IFeo1zaE1zzfu6g0VyHQ4zTSR0yok6KsooDJXKT2VCU&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1222/v-full-1222_Preview.vtt?token=MvYAadbiX1p8TQYmEVAmtKJkZ0I60O4kqN3Ab5DU8-c&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1222/v-full-1222_Presentation.mp4?token=gaFa_dsmLS09Xvwd2v9P1YeSJzg8r_Obr7bCGsZoHco&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1222/v-full-1222_Presentation.vtt?token=h9bFn52eQP69Uhqpm7htgcXfud97BfA7q1uNb4kO4dg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Guoxi Liu"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327182","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The image illustrates our proposed task-parallel approach, showcasing the pipeline with the dragon dataset.

However, topological features such as degenerate curves and neutral surfaces do not live in isolation. Instead, they intriguingly interact with each other. In this paper, we introduce the notion of {\\em topological graph} for 3D symmetric tensor fields to facilitate global topological analysis of such fields. The nodes of the graph include degenerate curves and regions bounded by neutral surfaces in the domain. The edges in the graph denote the adjacency information between the regions and degenerate curves. In addition, we observe that a degenerate curve can be a loop and even a knot and that two degenerate curves (whether in the same region or not) can form a link. We provide a definition and theoretical analysis of individual degenerate curves in order to help understand why knots and links may occur. Moreover, we differentiate between wedges and trisectors, thus making the analysis more detailed about degenerate curves. We incorporate this information into the topological graph. Such a graph can not only reveal the global structure in a 3D symmetric tensor field but also allow two symmetric tensor fields to be compared. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to solid mechanics and material science data sets.","authors":["Shih-Hsuan Hung","Yue Zhang","Eugene Zhang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1360/v-full-1360_Preview.mp4?token=jvMS3LvC50H7FbQLM98cCKYSUDp4aPsFpayySZGB8FI&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1360/v-full-1360_Preview.vtt?token=epNs0-TKf96lEQaomUjm5ZDpsGK_UQ4N_Q1vJ-HW6-g&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1360/v-full-1360_Presentation.mp4?token=WqgD6er63JBz_KYZCEQO3kD07ar40ndFE_FO6IYD_N8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1360/v-full-1360_Presentation.vtt?token=aIqK7dDW0YQN-7nl9GkY20y4ufvBodBNJ5upF5Jn0HA&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Professor Eugene Zhang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326933","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Existing topology-driven tensor field visualization focuses on the robust extraction of individual features such as degenerate curves and neutral surfaces (left: colored curves and surfaces).

In particular, confirmation bias can cause people to overweigh information that confirms their beliefs, and dismiss information that disconfirms them. We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowd workers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. We created two scenarios, one in which we primed people with a belief before asking them to make a decision, and another in which people held pre-existing beliefs. The data was presented as either a table, a bar table, or a bar chart. To correctly solve the problem, participants should use a complex reasoning strategy to compare two ratios, each between two pairs of values. But participants could also be tempted to use simpler, superficial heuristics, shortcuts, or biased strategies to reason about the problem. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of the ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. These findings suggest that data presentation formats can affect affordances for reasoning.","authors":["Cindy Xiong Bearfield","Elsie Lee-Robbins","Icy Zhang","Aimen Gaba","Steven L Franconeri"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10002893/v-tvcg-10002893_Preview.mp4?token=4TUONu8hDwbkTcZ5j16gmCNFg0YUqZuOvGOQt0sNkQE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10002893/v-tvcg-10002893_Preview.vtt?token=MSDdLEgW6TH_fU0haDgU-w89CXtKN24yyc7ZSFJ96Ok&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10002893/v-tvcg-10002893_Presentation.mp4?token=dYpme_8LyJYtTGoIzROLY0p6FcNEIk-9KJQH-ulqsEE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-10002893/v-tvcg-10002893_Presentation.vtt?token=_wFy6USOuawRBBE3VikhZLla7Kry8MNovTLDzDJu-jE&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Cindy Xiong"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3232959","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10002893","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"We studied confirmation bias in visualizations, asking participants to solve a hard reasoning problem.

Gender is a common demographic dimension of data collected from study or survey participants, passengers, or customers, as well as across academic studies, especially in certain disciplines like sociology. Our work contributes to multiple ongoing discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing specifc data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may, inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from fve different scientifc communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we found that representation types are community-specifc, color hue is the dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is under-represented. We end our paper with a discussion of considerations for gender visualization derived from our coding and the literature and recommendations for large data collection bodies.

As a consequence, disparate stakeholders need to interact with and make informed decisions about using machine learning models in everyday systems. Visualization technology can support stakeholders in understanding and evaluating trade-offs between, for example, accuracy and fairness of models. This paper aims to empirically answer \"Can visualization design choices affect a stakeholder's perception of model bias, trust in a model, and willingness to adopt a model?'\" Through a series of controlled, crowd-sourced experiments with more than 1,500 participants, we identify a set of strategies people follow in deciding which models to trust. Our results show that men and women prioritize fairness and performance differently and that visual design choices significantly affect that prioritization. For example, women trust fairer models more often than men do, participants value fairness more when it is explained using text than as a bar chart, and being explicitly told a model is biased has a bigger impact than showing past biased performance. We test the generalizability of our results by comparing the effect of multiple textual and visual design choices and offer potential explanations of the cognitive mechanisms behind the difference in fairness perception and trust. Our research guides design considerations to support future work developing visualization systems for machine learning.","authors":["Aimen Gaba","Zhanna Kaufman","Jason Cheung","Marie Shvakel","Kyle Wm Hall","Yuriy Brun","Cindy Xiong Bearfield"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1073/v-full-1073_Preview.mp4?token=oFqPJQaFDIdDGkBiPhhyWkqGOAYC5mV-m4ixNCbGGn0&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1073/v-full-1073_Preview.vtt?token=EtIe-qaulAKN7RqYblHexr9HtD4v_QcYW4CCbHb91p4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1073/v-full-1073_Presentation.mp4?token=ubjz-NxLtsmyF2mBaI1EpTFlNnjc9LNllrc2TPY9hcQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1073/v-full-1073_Presentation.vtt?token=hVbV-bE3scjPYjojPzmtMr2UU-UtzlePnn0bO1b8tro&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Aimen Gaba, Zhanna Kaufman"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327192","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We conducted a user study, asking participants to select between two automated investors, one historically producing fair returns for men and women (top left) and the other producing higher returns but exhibiting sexist behavior, favoring either men or women (top right).

While research in social sciences outlines the multi-dimensional factors that can play a role in trust formation, most data visualization trust researchers employ a single-item scale to measure trust. We address this gap by proposing a comprehensive, multidimensional conceptualization and operationalization of trust in visualization. We do this by applying general theories of trust from social sciences, as well as synthesizing and extending earlier work and factors identified by studies in the visualization field. We apply a two-dimensional approach to trust in visualization, to distinguish between cognitive and affective elements, as well as between visualization and data-specific trust antecedents. We use our framework to design and run a large crowd-sourced study to quantify the role of visual complexity in establishing trust in science visualizations. Our study provides empirical evidence for several aspects of our proposed theoretical framework, most notably the impact of cognition, affective responses, and individual differences when establishing trust in visualizations.","authors":["Hamza Elhamdadi","Adam Stefkovics","Johanna Beyer","Eric Moerth","Hanspeter Pfister","Cindy Xiong Bearfield","Carolina Nobre"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1522/v-full-1522_Preview.mp4?token=tT1Z--igamMRKhOXYV_6geRljhA63O-JS0PJAx6nS0k&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1522/v-full-1522_Preview.vtt?token=loL0IQ0xwB0XZIRFXnL-I24POa0gyasea7YNynNF0MI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1522/v-full-1522_Presentation.mp4?token=9wBB4WS14mNZUPXJEhDO2ihhIelNzyw9nKLXfALiwIQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1522/v-full-1522_Presentation.vtt?token=8Nk87Eo_TRnbf85RHnL05_LgQkMAQ21-lGXpTHAU9Qo&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Hamza Elhamdadi"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326579","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"An integrated framework, which outlines the development of trust in visualizations.

Accuracy and error metrics alone fail to tell the whole story of a model \u2013 its risks, strengths, and limitations \u2013 making it difficult for subject matter experts to feel confident in their decision to use a model.  As a result, models may fail in unexpected ways or go entirely unused, as subject matter experts disregard poorly presented models in favor of familiar, yet arguably substandard methods.  In this paper, we describe an iterative study conducted with both subject matter experts and data scientists to understand the gaps in communication between these two groups.  We find that, while the two groups share common goals of understanding the data and predictions of the model, friction can stem from unfamiliar terms, metrics, and visualizations \u2013 limiting the transfer of knowledge to SMEs and discouraging clarifying questions being asked during presentations.  Based on our findings, we derive a set of communication guidelines that use visualization as a common medium for communicating the strengths and weaknesses of a model.  We provide a demonstration of our guidelines in a regression modeling scenario and elicit feedback on their use from subject matter experts.  From our demonstration, subject matter experts were more comfortable discussing a model's performance, more aware of the trade-offs for the presented model, and better equipped to assess the model's risks \u2013 ultimately informing and contextualizing the model's use beyond text and numbers.","authors":["Ashley Suh","Gabriel Appleby","Erik W.

Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively (\"live\") and the other updates only on demand (\"dead\"). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users.

However, many of them capture empirical associations that might be spurious due to confounding factors and subgroup heterogeneity. The famous Simpson\u2019s paradox is such a phenomenon where aggregated and subgroup-level associations contradict with each other, causing cognitive confusions and difficulty in making adequate interpretations and decisions. Existing tools provide little insights for humans to locate, reason about, and prevent pitfalls of spurious association in practice. We propose VISPUR, a visual analytic system that provides a causal analysis framework and a human-centric workflow for tackling spurious associations. These include a CONFOUNDER DASHBOARD, which can automatically identify possible confounding factors, and a SUBGROUP VIEWER, which allows for the visualization and comparison of diverse subgroup patterns that likely or potentially result in a misinterpretation of causality. Additionally, we propose a REASONING STORYBOARD, which uses a flow-based approach to illustrate paradoxical phenomena, as well as an interactive DECISION DIAGNOSIS panel that helps ensure accountable decision-making. Through an expert interview and a controlled user experiment, our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed \u201cde-paradox\u201d workflow and the designed visual analytic system are effective in helping human users to identify and understand spurious associations, as well as to make accountable causal decisions.","authors":["Xian Teng","Yongsu Ahn","Yu-Ru Lin"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1594/v-full-1594_Preview.mp4?token=3llvqu7L-mLpFp9YKVPtjL29ArmF2gTXvS9tZTDw7c8&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1594/v-full-1594_Preview.vtt?token=k7zFVMZd46vDLp0oInH8x1PKBKdmlh2RD5wCDTXOnkE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1594/v-full-1594_Presentation.mp4?token=WVbBCMZrVBzQd63n5yxVbZfVoFy5Cv7MJagSC5NApwU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1594/v-full-1594_Presentation.vtt?token=cDjtQtT8sMfuIVQrWQjX3yVrMrTig8Z0WJNeJb2wSKk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Xian Teng"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326587","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This work provides a de-paradox workflow to help analyze observational data and overcome spurious and paradoxical associations.

Understanding how these professionals utilize visual representations in their analytic process may shed light on best practices for visual sensemaking. We present results from an interview study involving 18 professional statisticians (19.7 years average in the profession) on three aspects: (1) their use of visualization in their daily analytic work; (2) their mental models of inferential statistical processes; and (3) their design recommendations for how to best represent statistical inferences. Interview sessions consisted of discussing inferential statistics, eliciting participant sketches of suitable visual designs, and finally, a design intervention with our proposed visual designs. We analyzed interview transcripts using thematic analysis and open coding, deriving thematic codes on statistical mindset, analytic process, and analytic toolkit. The key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make extensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just when reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to be mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous thinking. The latter suggests that a multi-faceted visual display of inferential statistics that includes a visual indicator of analytically important effect sizes may help to balance the attributed epistemic power of traditional statistical testing with an awareness of the uncertainty of sensemaking.","authors":["Eric Newburger","Niklas Elmqvist"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1508/v-full-1508_Preview.mp4?token=XmYCrKCl6_JsUzddQL3AyeLBCL_b-6Y7WhFo3Xfqqvs&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1508/v-full-1508_Preview.vtt?token=7lukTuuknhEx2KtOd1COsxpNQBoypXxf7ROyWLz6dyY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1508/v-full-1508_Presentation.mp4?token=M_cnK4NaHX5p4z9c8kyHY0SDB2wP-23CvCPNe8ix_5o&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1508/v-full-1508_Presentation.vtt?token=B1i1Rr9I3NIoH-Qy086gbNfex8X93iyfkTZgv48-9JU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Eric Newburger"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326521","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"How do professional statisticians use data visualization?

In real-world applications, analysts often employ several algorithms concurrently and compare their solution sets to gain insight into the characteristics of different algorithms and explore a broader range of feasible solutions. However, EMO algorithms are typically treated as black boxes, leading to difficulties in performing detailed analysis and comparisons between the internal evolutionary processes. Inspired by the successful application of visual analytics tools in explainable AI, we argue that interactive visualization can significantly enhance the comparative analysis between multiple EMO algorithms. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO algorithms. Guided by a literature review and expert interviews, the proposed framework addresses various analytical tasks and establishes a multi-faceted visualization design to support the comparative analysis of intermediate generations in the evolution as well as solution sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through case studies on benchmarking and real-world multi-objective optimization problems to elucidate how analysts can leverage our framework to inspect and compare diverse algorithms.","authors":["Yansong Huang","Zherui Zhang","Ao Jiao","Yuxin Ma","Ran Cheng"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1227/v-full-1227_Preview.mp4?token=vSE-u8yLLb_WJQSumkRCm_ZKXLv_tLILSmUDcKYbNzk&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1227/v-full-1227_Preview.vtt?token=CgQvjoKBVYghsKAuc9tk0t-5GYtAoO6Dsylh3PmNOaQ&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1227/v-full-1227_Presentation.mp4?token=Gjj0Zu7HDLU5nq8UG3ojLKMdiYKXmNsKh7Hf0gpENx4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1227/v-full-1227_Presentation.vtt?token=UDapXMQHvUB48QAEF6P5CHc96t_vFsXMGSWLWQjZ3j8&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Zherui Zhang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326921","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We propose a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO algorithms.

While the focus of VA for explainable DL has been mainly on classification problems, DL is gaining popularity in high-dimensional-to-high-dimensional (H-H) problems such as image-to-image translation. In contrast to classification, H-H problems have no explicit instance groups or classes to study. Each output is continuous, high-dimensional, and changes in an unknown non-linear manner with changes in the input. These unknown relations between the input, model and output necessitate the user to analyze them in conjunction, leveraging symmetries between them. Since classification tasks do not exhibit some of these challenges, most existing VA systems and frameworks allow limited control of the components required to analyze models beyond classification. Hence, we identify the need for and present a unified conceptual framework, the Transform-and-Perform framework (T&P), to facilitate the design of VA systems for DL model analysis focusing on H-H problems. T&P provides a checklist to structure and identify workflows and analysis strategies to design new VA systems, and understand existing ones to uncover potential gaps for improvements. The goal is to aid the creation of effective VA systems that support the structuring of model understanding and identifying actionable insights for model improvements. We highlight the growing need for new frameworks like T&P with a real-world image-to image translation application. We illustrate how T&P effectively supports the understanding and identification of potential gaps in existing VA systems.","authors":["Vidya Prasad","Ruud J.

Typically, classification rules or decision trees are used due to their logic-based expressions. However, decision trees can grow too deep, and rule sets can become too large to approximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share ancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured visual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules. In this paper, we focus on tabular data and present novel algorithmic and interactive solutions to address these issues. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules (HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined parameters. We also contribute SURE, a visual analytics (VA) system that integrates HSR and an interactive surrogate rule visualization, the Feature-Aligned Tree, which depicts rules as trees while aligning features for easier comparison. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter sensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and find that it scales reasonably well and overcomes the shortcomings of surrogate decision trees. We evaluate the visualization and the system through a usability study and an observational study with domain experts. Our investigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to perform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy. We also discuss many interesting findings, including a rule analysis task characterization, that can be used for visualization design and future research.","authors":["Jun Yuan","Brian Barr","Kyle Overton","Enrico Bertini"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9937064/v-tvcg-9937064_Preview.mp4?token=PpcGyHaOiaB2LtmJ0r8powxm89Z8mTICgLbqHe10uH8&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9937064/v-tvcg-9937064_Preview.vtt?token=3cg58dUQA4M3JuRJHnRU2fJMQFmHxLKBwbtYG-z7Izs&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9937064/v-tvcg-9937064_Presentation.mp4?token=q23QzRueTvsR0p4ljyCVFYSDZl0JGr6J8uFrcy6mhRs&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-9937064/v-tvcg-9937064_Presentation.vtt?token=HJhh47W3UD_Dvx8CW8Fv8fewn6X9nfovgbszBeMqebk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Jun Yuan"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3219232","external_paper_link":"","fno":"9937064","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"SuRE is a visual analytics (VA) system that integrates hierarchical surrogate rule generation and an interactive surrogate rule visualization, the Feature-Aligned Tree, which depicts rules as trees while aligning features for easier comparison.","keywords":["visualization;rule set;surrogate model;model understanding"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full30","slot_id":"v-tvcg-9937064","time_end":"2023-10-25T05:21:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T05:09:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T05:09:00Z","title":"Visual Exploration of Machine Learning Model Behavior with Hierarchical Surrogate Rule Sets","uid":"v-tvcg-9937064","youtube_ff_id":"Ao8r2hjVils","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/Ao8r2hjVils","youtube_prerecorded_id":"BMVvNfxg7O8","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/BMVvNfxg7O8"},{"abstract":"Visualization for machine learning (VIS4ML) research aims to help experts apply their prior knowledge to develop, understand, and improve the performance of machine learning models. In conceiving VIS4ML systems, researchers characterize the nature of human knowledge to support human-in-the-loop tasks, design interactive visualizations to make ML components interpretable and elicit knowledge, and evaluate the effectiveness of human-model interchange. We survey recent VIS4ML papers to assess the generalizability of research contributions and claims in enabling human-in-the-loop ML. Our results show potential gaps between the current scope of VIS4ML research and aspirations for its use in practice. We find that while papers motivate that VIS4ML systems are applicable beyond the specific conditions studied, conclusions are often overfitted to non-representative scenarios, are based on interactions with a small set of ML experts and well-understood datasets, fail to acknowledge crucial dependencies, and hinge on decisions that lack justification. We discuss approaches to close the gap between aspirations and research claims and suggest documentation practices to report generality constraints that better acknowledge the exploratory nature of VIS4ML research.","authors":["Hariharan Subramonyam","Jessica Hullman"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1753/v-full-1753_Preview.mp4?token=kIQLr3JHao5Oc2gfh9xBawDw6JECYzIYxiga_Qts5qU&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1753/v-full-1753_Preview.vtt?token=R2Pm0JR6j-YTwSk0P6NUldFpZIIU37B1a6hhrSTVHF8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1753/v-full-1753_Presentation.mp4?token=zubQVQV0vmqMvDUtZWLPiys113jlZmE9Ir_OsJablj4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1753/v-full-1753_Presentation.vtt?token=X4RY2ssGNfvO8EXi_YsO1E_cUXXlKXu3V8rdv_qPPfU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Hariharan Subramonyam"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326591","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Two concentric circles divided into four segments with the four main finding groups including human expertise, hitl tasks, ml components, and vis4ml tools.

However, developers often struggle with debugging due to the black-box nature of neural networks. Visual analytics provides an intuitive way for developers to understand the hidden states and underlying complex transformations in neural networks. Existing visual analytics tools for neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective in providing useful hints for debugging certain network architectures. However, these approaches are often architecture-specific with strong assumptions of how the network should be understood. This limits their use when the network architecture or the exploration goal changes. In this paper, we present a general model and a programming toolkit, Neural Network Visualization Builder (NNVisBuilder), for prototyping visual analytics systems to understand neural networks. NNVisBuilder covers the common data transformation and interaction model involved in existing tools for exploring neural networks. It enables developers to customize a visual analytics interface for answering their specific questions about networks. NNVisBuilder is compatible with PyTorch so that developers can integrate the visualization code into their learning code seamlessly. We demonstrate the applicability by reproducing several existing visual analytics systems for networks with NNVisBuilder.

However, designing interactive physicalizations is challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in visualization, fabrication, and electronics. Interactive physicalizations are typically produced in an unstructured manner, resulting in unique solutions for a specific dataset, problem, or interaction that cannot be easily extended or adapted to new scenarios or future physicalizations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a computational design pipeline to 3D print network physicalizations with integrated sensing capabilities. Networks are ubiquitous, yet their complex geometry also requires significant engineering considerations to provide intuitive, effective interactions for exploration. Using our pipeline, designers can readily produce network physicalizations supporting selection\u2014the most critical atomic operation for interaction\u2014by touch through capacitive sensing and computational inference. Our computational design pipeline introduces a new design paradigm by concurrently considering the form and interactivity of a physicalization into one cohesive fabrication workflow. We evaluate our approach using (i) computational evaluations, (ii) three usage scenarios focusing on general visualization tasks, and (iii) expert interviews. The design paradigm introduced by our pipeline can lower barriers to physicalization research, creation, and adoption.","authors":["S.

We design and implement Dupo, a mixed-initiative approach to creating responsive visualizations that combines the agency afforded by a manual interface with automation provided by a recommender system. Given an initial design, users can browse automated design suggestions for a different screen type and make edits to a chosen design, thereby supporting quick prototyping and customizability. Dupo employs a two-step recommender pipeline that first suggests significant design changes (Exploration) followed by more subtle changes (Alteration). We evaluated Dupo with six expert responsive visualization authors. While creating responsive versions of a source design in Dupo, participants could reason about different design suggestions without having to manually prototype them, and thus avoid prematurely fixating on a particular design. This process led participants to create designs that they were satisfied with but which they had previously overlooked.","authors":["Hyeok Kim","Ryan Rossi","Jessica Hullman","Jane Hoffswell"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1020/v-full-1020_Preview.mp4?token=Pbu2HsS9cB7xtIcKPTUkFIK5MxdgL2KfCCc1v1ViQzE&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1020/v-full-1020_Preview.vtt?token=2fkEdUVxzo0-L-7PfcIFNGobUi2uJxkowuifTO4dN-Q&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1020/v-full-1020_Presentation.mp4?token=kisOqTTMSqfA7AhHfIxYMdhxPOOAQNEIJPxoq4p5iB0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1020/v-full-1020_Presentation.vtt?token=KsReZSrxXPIJsNAk4naHm5D8toq_BpRVnrulFMQBxDU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Hyeok Kim"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326583","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Dupo is a mixed-initiative authoring tool for responsive visualization.

Effective documentation for explaining chart findings during the exploration process is essential as it helps recall and share data analysis. However, documenting chart findings remains a challenge due to its time-consuming and tedious nature.  While existing automatic methods alleviate some of the burden on users, they often fail to cater to users' specific interests.  In response to these limitations, we present InkSight, a mixed-initiative computational notebook plugin that generates finding documentation based on the user's intent. InkSight allows users to express their intent in specific data subsets through sketching atop visualizations intuitively. To facilitate this, we designed two types of sketches, i.e., open-path and closed-path sketch. Upon receiving a user's sketch, InkSight identifies the sketch type and corresponding selected data items.  Subsequently, it filters data fact types based on the sketch and selected data items  before employing existing automatic data fact recommendation algorithms to infer data facts.  Using large language models (GPT-3.5), InkSight converts data facts into effective natural language documentation. Users can conveniently fine-tune the generated documentation within InkSight.

Numerous books and articles have been written to expose the misleading potential of poorly constructed charts and teach people how to avoid being deceived by them or making their own mistakes. These readings use various rhetorical devices to explain the concepts to their readers. In our analysis of a collection of books, online materials, and a design workshop, we identified six common explanation methods. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted two crowdsourced studies (each with N = 125) to evaluate their ability to teach and persuade people to make design changes. In addition to these existing methods, we brought in the idea of Explorable Explanations, which allows readers to experiment with different chart settings and observe how the changes are reflected in the visualization. While we did not find significant differences across explanation methods, the results of our experiments indicate that, following the exposure to the explanations, the participants showed improved proficiency in identifying deceptive charts and were more receptive to proposed alterations of the visualization design. We discovered that participants were willing to accept more than 60% of the proposed adjustments in the persuasiveness assessment. Nevertheless, we found no significant differences among different explanation methods in convincing participants to accept the modifications.","authors":["Leo Yu-Ho Lo","Yi-Fan Cao","Leni Yang","Huamin Qu"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1159/v-full-1159_Preview.mp4?token=ShOEpxKSO4VVZ5Il6WAEUd5Y8L7y7g8vQpzHxciBCTg&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1159/v-full-1159_Preview.vtt?token=keYUW5B7Ut-CJU-OVpcW9WyDxWhCjfSBZ15E8dItqwY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1159/v-full-1159_Presentation.mp4?token=x294Gt9CwHlO_a_cWTa9MxTQpKatdJ3QhzzvCSfYTiY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1159/v-full-1159_Presentation.vtt?token=r-4bekt0AAoqxxS-zOOyHy-rgUcRYoz8fIk46z27NUo&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Leo Yu-Ho Lo"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327155","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Explorable explanation designs for five different common chart issues studied in the paper \"Why Change My Design: Explaining Poorly Constructed Visualization Designs with Explorable Explanations\"","keywords":["Information Visualization, Deceptive Visualization, Explorable Explanations"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full31","slot_id":"v-full-1159","time_end":"2023-10-26T00:57:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T00:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T00:45:00Z","title":"Why Change My Design: Explaining Poorly Constructed Visualization Designs with Explorable Explanations","uid":"v-full-1159","youtube_ff_id":"Bwdk5t-Qy0A","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/Bwdk5t-Qy0A","youtube_prerecorded_id":"966i7IF1IEI","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/966i7IF1IEI"}],"time_start":"2023-10-25T23:45:00Z","title":"Visualization Design and User Experience","track":"oneohfive","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Thomas Chandler"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"109","discord_channel_id":"1161741434647482379","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741434647482379","event_prefix":"v-full","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/HkkO4SwyruE","session_id":"full32","session_image":"full32.png","time_end":"2023-10-25T04:15:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"Science has long been viewed as a key driver of economic growth and rising standards of living. Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation. Through both the case studies and the engagement project, we find that our system not only meets our original goals of design, allowing users to better identify the sources of technical inventions and to understand the broad impact of scientific research; it also goes beyond these purposes to enable an array of new applications for researchers and research institutions, ranging from identifying untapped innovation potential within an institution to forging new collaboration opportunities between science and industry.","authors":["Yifang Wang","Yifan Qian","Xiaoyu Qi","Nan Cao","Dashun Wang"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1104/v-full-1104_Preview.mp4?token=5DjYZO7iqgO4UMV8bbSPq626QNszUszxthzfFh5yHFU&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1104/v-full-1104_Preview.vtt?token=mrG3eWiJ0ZORhpG7Mio2cQkF677UaIsZtvQnYL58FuU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1104/v-full-1104_Presentation.mp4?token=XqHZaLkED4QfEc9QfMD1q68f8mAxI9epStTltFJ1Qc8&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1104/v-full-1104_Presentation.vtt?token=GZeMC9lTiL0R9zFON84OPa9ogY-ZxzIIKZogiZJRZ2k&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Dr. Yifang Wang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327387","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Science is central to improving the human condition.

We characterize key analysis tasks among whale researchers for this database, most important of which is inferring spatial distribution of whale populations over time. In addition to facilitating analysis of whale catches based on the spatio-temporal attributes, we use whaling expedition details to plot the search routes of expeditions. We propose a model of the catch data as a graph, where nodes represent catch locations, and edges represent whaling expedition routes. This model facilitates visual estimation of whale search effort and in turn the spatial distribution of whale populations normalized by the search effort\u2014a well known problem in fisheries research. It further opens up new avenues for graph analysis on the data, including more rigorous computation of spatial distribution of whales normalized by the search effort, and enabling new insight generation.

Since fewer expeditions traversed those waters, we are aware of a relative reduction in search effort when inferring the whale populations from reported catches in those regions.","keywords":["Whaling, conservation, data visualization dashboards"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","session_id":"full32","slot_id":"v-short-1083","time_end":"2023-10-25T04:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T04:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T04:00:00Z","title":"WhaleVis: Visualizing the History of Commercial Whaling","uid":"v-short-1083","youtube_ff_id":"sxkZSOc59FQ","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/sxkZSOc59FQ","youtube_prerecorded_id":"BU8FMbzAfpc","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/BU8FMbzAfpc"}],"time_start":"2023-10-25T03:00:00Z","title":"Visualization for Humanities and Social Sciences (Full+Short)","track":"oneohnine","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Markus Hadwiger"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"103","discord_channel_id":"1161741183815524502","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741183815524502","event_prefix":"v-full","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/nxvvz1y6AwY","session_id":"full33","session_image":"full33.png","time_end":"2023-10-25T23:15:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"Dr. KID is an algorithm that uses isometric decomposition for the physicalization of potato-shaped organic models in a puzzle fashion. The algorithm begins with creating a simple, regular triangular surface mesh of organic shapes, followed by iterative K-means clustering and remeshing. For clustering, we need similarity between triangles (segments) which is defined as a distance function. The distance function maps each triangle's shape to a single point in the virtual 3D space. Thus, the distance between the triangles indicates their degree of dissimilarity. K-means clustering uses this distance and sorts segments into k classes. After this, remeshing is applied to minimize the distance between triangles within the same cluster by making their shapes identical. Clustering and remeshing are repeated until the distance between triangles in the same cluster reaches an acceptable threshold. We adopt a curvature-aware strategy to determine the surface thickness and finalize puzzle pieces for 3D printing. Identical hinges and holes are created for assembling the puzzle components. For smoother outcomes, we use triangle subdivision along with curvature-aware clustering, generating curved triangular patches for 3D printing. Our algorithm was evaluated using various models, and the 3D-printed results were analyzed. Findings indicate that our algorithm performs reliably on target organic shapes with minimal loss of input geometry.","authors":["Dawar Khan","Ciril Bohak","Ivan Viola"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1673/v-full-1673_Preview.mp4?token=aclp_AwRvcs8ZmdL-lLcsviSey6JdtsccphSk11vD_I&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1673/v-full-1673_Preview.vtt?token=i_Tf803J3-LNpa2hisLEdbgHpK60lZFXfGPFabXyPgw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1673/v-full-1673_Presentation.mp4?token=uGR037nlG6US5OytWr0ZiDTBDZsy18hC10LenlurUhc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1673/v-full-1673_Presentation.vtt?token=raIsTUrDQxLqbpIF57WzGUSbhOCsVjbZryH_dcQp5sg&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Dawar Khan"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326595","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The physicalization of potato-shaped biological structures with k types of triangles.

Extracting and characterizing hairpin vortices provides useful insight into many behaviors in turbulent flows. However, hairpin vortices have complex configurations and might be entangled with other vortices, making their extraction difficult. In this work, we introduce a framework to extract and separate hairpin vortices in shear driven turbulent flows for their study. Our method first extracts general vortical regions with a region-growing strategy based on certain vortex criteria (e.g., \u03bb2) and then separates those vortices with the help of progressive extraction of (\u03bb2) iso-surfaces in a top-down fashion. This leads to a hierarchical tree representing the spatial proximity and merging relation of vortices. After separating individual vortices, their shape and orientation information is extracted. Candidate hairpin vortices are identified based on their shape and orientation information as well as their physical characteristics. An interactive visualization system is developed to aid the exploration, classification, and analysis of hairpin vortices based on their geometric and physical attributes. We also present additional use cases of the proposed system for the analysis and study of general vortices in other types of flows.","authors":["Adeel Zafar","Di Yang","Guoning Chen"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1669/v-full-1669_Preview.mp4?token=4nOlTgO04uVkOoscBRG4ayEJPhuluZWaMZDova-yQKk&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1669/v-full-1669_Preview.vtt?token=URyo7lYOTReNrhMvY9X2y36rz7trxXvt7cWf3nVL9bY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1669/v-full-1669_Presentation.mp4?token=EKAtISmgh2oXHuRNZgyWASQ8v0zj46twoZKa0zDkYrw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1669/v-full-1669_Presentation.vtt?token=00y9sAje2mxfdNVVkiSaiLe3JDtfjXGQ4MRBbdXpQ2E&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Adeel Zafar"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326603","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Extract, separate, identify and characterize hairpin vortices in turbulent flows","keywords":["Turbulent flow, vortices, hairpin vortex extraction"],"paper_award":"honorable","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full33","slot_id":"v-full-1669","time_end":"2023-10-25T22:24:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T22:12:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T22:12:00Z","title":"Extract and Characterize Hairpin Vortices in Turbulent Flows","uid":"v-full-1669","youtube_ff_id":"Gemap7uU6_o","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/Gemap7uU6_o","youtube_prerecorded_id":"TpJUFmReA-M","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/TpJUFmReA-M"},{"abstract":"Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are ubiquitous in cutting-edge physio-chemical research. They provide critical insights into how a physical system evolves over time given a model of interatomic interactions. Understanding a system\u2019s evolution is key to selecting the best candidates for new drugs, materials for manufacturing, and countless other practical applications. With today\u2019s technology, these simulations can encompass millions of unit transitions between discrete molecular structures, spanning up to several milliseconds of real time. Attempting to perform a brute-force analysis with data-sets of this size is not only computationally impractical, but would not shed light on the physically-relevant features of the data. Moreover, there is a need to analyze simulation ensembles in order to compare similar processes in differing environments. These problems call for an approach that is analytically transparent, computationally efficient, and flexible enough to handle the variety found in materials-based research. In order to address these problems, we introduce MolSieve, a progressive visual analytics system that enables the comparison of multiple long-duration simulations. Using MolSieve, analysts are able to quickly identify and compare regions of interest within immense simulations through its combination of control charts, data-reduction techniques, and highly informative visual components. A simple programming interface is provided which allows experts to fit MolSieve to their needs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present two case studies of MolSieve and report on findings from domain collaborators.","authors":["Rostyslav Hnatyshyn","Jieqiong Zhao","Danny Perez","James Ahrens","Ross Maciejewski"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1530/v-full-1530_Preview.mp4?token=LhQcaX8xA_Rm2iX0VZJTSSHFYdm141_Gw75OMFR4R38&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1530/v-full-1530_Preview.vtt?token=2EYka_jrqZMl1u4guciWiRLfzsRybtApcKNO9UcoLTs&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1530/v-full-1530_Presentation.mp4?token=C9Q03lSJ1ntx88NCOszxlFKMQYsFdA_rnbQ_t3GYgac&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1530/v-full-1530_Presentation.vtt?token=YZtlZmioYiTXQqHfa2Mwm_gZQtWWb6yGBFmU4NGCTMQ&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Rostyslav Hnatyshyn"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326584","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"MolSieve is a visual analytics system that reduces large molecular dynamics simulations into their essential components.

Numerical weather models, in turn, are complex tools that require specialized training and laborious setup and are challenging even for weather experts. Moreover, weather simulations are data-intensive computations and may take hours to days to complete. When the simulation is finished, the experts face challenges analyzing its outputs, a large mass of spatiotemporal and multivariate data. From the simulation setup to the analysis of results, working with weather simulations involves several manual and error-prone steps. The complexity of the problem increases exponentially when the experts must deal with ensembles of simulations, a frequent task in their daily duties. To tackle these challenges, we propose ProWis: an interactive and provenance-oriented system to help weather experts build, manage, and analyze simulation ensembles at runtime. Our system follows a human-in-the-loop approach to enable the exploration of multiple atmospheric variables and weather scenarios. ProWis was built in close collaboration with weather experts, and we demonstrate its effectiveness by presenting two case studies of rainfall events in Brazil.","authors":["Carolina Veiga Ferreira de Souza","Suzanna Maria Bonnet","Daniel de Oliveira","Marcio Cataldi","Fabio Miranda","Marcos Lage"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1773/v-full-1773_Preview.mp4?token=LMHc2pDgzN7VMfROsDd-vsCF4j9jQq7vCfDmoXY_09s&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1773/v-full-1773_Preview.vtt?token=5Fku0ZtIRaax1ijvVpgMdYh2IL-jslnwJM4IsZHJKZ4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1773/v-full-1773_Presentation.mp4?token=T8RxQWt9LFyPxoZk0WF0-OWJM6vGaCfJpP4PDFZgwrw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1773/v-full-1773_Presentation.vtt?token=C8wjpqMPf92hOcybIOUbXY9usIlcOeNtuLYcQ-RNT7o&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Marcos Lage"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326514","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We present the Provenance-enabled Weather Visualization (ProWis) system, a visual analytics system to assist weather professionals to work with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF).

Neuroscientists are analyzing these networks to better understand information processing in the brain. In particular, scientists are interested in identifying specific small network motifs, i.e., repeating subgraphs of the larger brain network that are believed to be neuronal building blocks. Although such motifs are typically small (e.g., 2 -6 neurons), the vast data sizes and intricate data complexity present significant challenges to the search and analysis process. To analyze these motifs, it is crucial to review instances of a motif in the brain network and then map the graph structure to detailed 3D reconstructions of the involved neurons and synapses. We present Vimo, an interactive visual approach to analyze neuronal motifs and motif chains in large brain networks. Experts can sketch network motifs intuitively in a visual interface and specify structural properties of the involved neurons and synapses to query large connectomics datasets. Motif instances (MIs) can be explored in high-resolution 3D renderings. To simplify the analysis of MIs, we designed a continuous focus&context metaphor inspired by visual abstractions. This allows users to transition from a highly-detailed rendering of the anatomical structure to views that emphasize the underlying motif structure and synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, Vimo supports the identification of motif chains where a motif is used repeatedly (e.g., 2 -4 times) to form a larger network structure. We evaluate Vimo in a user study and an in-depth case study with seven domain experts on motifs in a large connectome of the fruit fly, including more than 21,000 neurons and 20 million synapses. We find that Vimo enables hypothesis generation and confirmation through fast analysis iterations and connectivity highlighting.","authors":["Jakob Troidl","Simon Alexander Warchol","Jinhan Choi","Jordan Matelsky","Nagaraju Dhanyasi","Xueying Wang","Brock Wester","Donglai Wei","Jeff Lichtman","Hanspeter Pfister","Johanna Beyer"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1253/v-full-1253_Preview.mp4?token=xhPQ4Gw2nzESmn8StseMrBnJMolGQd5pVoi8C_bbHlY&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1253/v-full-1253_Preview.vtt?token=TArhsDreBtN_YBpUIJ1m1EQzH3N7fMyhhrqIjIJZ0t4&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1253/v-full-1253_Presentation.mp4?token=sOK0Rmab9bUTuxmNOhhMjsooeL_1eLAkZG2yFZqzhIY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-full/v-full-1253/v-full-1253_Presentation.vtt?token=KMMUQKV235aWMVBQ_jB_NcGhgkNIATFGpRONXsCEaLk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Jakob Troidl"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327388","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Vimo is a visual analysis tool to search and analyze arbitrary connectivity motifs in large brain networks.","keywords":["Visual motif analysis, Focus&Context, Scientific visualization, Neuroscience, Connectomics."],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","session_id":"full33","slot_id":"v-full-1253","time_end":"2023-10-25T23:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T22:48:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T22:48:00Z","title":"Vimo: Visual Analysis of Neuronal Connectivity Motifs","uid":"v-full-1253","youtube_ff_id":"9OEPANsTtjs","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/9OEPANsTtjs","youtube_prerecorded_id":"MtAWc_XoilE","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/MtAWc_XoilE"},{"abstract":"We developed a new approach comprised of different visualizations for the comparative spatio-temporal analysis of displacement processes in porous media.

To facilitate analysis and comprehension of networks using various interaction techniques, such as zooming, tooltip, and highlight, we have implemented a Spiral Visualization dashboard. We conducted a qualitative user study incorporating observation, think-aloud protocols, and participant rating of confidence and easiness to assess the usability and suitability of our visualization. The findings suggest that our visualization is appropriate for the network tasks evaluated. However, tasks requiring color comparison, such as identifying the densest community and comparing community densities were found to be more challenging to perform.","authors":["Garima Jindal","Kamalakar Karlapalem"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1160/v-short-1160_Preview.mp4?token=8MvNTsr5nzy5h1O_PpKqNmGGlsz2RTQjhXn4PnBtxVI&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1160/v-short-1160_Preview.vtt?token=CnxznuSHkPTXxDeTxFPMYzGga3_tFX_2lPJT-qMtKCc&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1160/v-short-1160_Presentation.mp4?token=y4q3YlTqsi0cFPB6tNIHTBKb6xBUgOnT-mFA0wNCNIg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1160/v-short-1160_Presentation.vtt?token=rcBnOe5OQFWXIi9275P0WJaa7jbd05_4sJJWFLHx8cU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Graima Jindal"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This figure presents a Spiral Visualization on the Facebook dataset having 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges.

However, creating a graph visualization either requires users to manually construct a graph by hand or programming skills. We present ProtoGraph, an English-like programming language for non-expert users to rapidly specify and animate node-link graph visualizations. The language supports iterative prototyping, thereby allowing non-experts users to intuitively refine their graphs, and to easily create animated graphs. The key features of ProtoGraph include a web-based live coding interface, previews for the different states in an animated graph, integrated user documentation, and an active-learning style tutorial. We have integrated the ProtoGraph language into an open-source JavaScript graph visualization library for rendering and a graphical web interface for rapid prototyping. In a user study, we show that participants with varying coding experiences were able to quickly learn the ProtoGraph language and create real-world pedagogical visualizations, showing that ProtoGraph is easy to learn, efficient to use, and extensible.","authors":["Machiel Daniel Rodrigues","Joel Dapello","Priyan Vaithilingam","Johanna Beyer","Carolina Nobre"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1189/v-short-1189_Preview.mp4?token=16ghbk6ZTHBknYxcQZiYhCJ61kvLW4RoqSw8e8cTm64&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1189/v-short-1189_Preview.vtt?token=nvSP1EsaZW-q_O2D4hLPplslGbZeHZuwyGGGHUGzDQU&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1189/v-short-1189_Presentation.mp4?token=nYmMli0Ban-A66zzU2Z96q3ukNJHozWGY9K7iSLGd9M&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1189/v-short-1189_Presentation.vtt?token=9oQ5vsh-OfCGLMwYrpnJ77hL9glECViW3iICYaxewSI&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Carolina Nobre"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"ProtoGraph web tool interface.

While visual model estimation has been studied extensively, visual model validation remains under-investigated. It is unknown how well people are able to visually validate models, and how their performance compares to visual and computational estimation. As a starting point, we conducted a study across two populations (crowdsourced and volunteers). Participants had to both visually estimate (i.e, draw) and visually validate (i.e., accept or reject) the frequently studied model of averages. Across both populations, the level of accuracy of the models that were considered valid was lower than the accuracy of the estimated models. We find that participants\u2019 validation and estimation were unbiased. Moreover, their natural critical point between accepting and rejecting a given mean value is close to the boundary of its 95% confidence interval, indicating that the visually perceived confidence interval corresponds to a common statistical standard. Our work contributes to the understanding of visual model validation and opens new research opportunities.","authors":["Daniel Braun","Ashley Suh","Remco Chang","Michael Gleicher","Tatiana von Landesberger"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1103/v-short-1103_Preview.mp4?token=sdjZ2sSlFUruVV6xHGJYkfT1HWe9NRyPWvYv0T8nODk&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1103/v-short-1103_Preview.vtt?token=Pveb3pHDZ74B342AJOySb6Sg7HQq9uGYP3oQfodPIAk&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1103/v-short-1103_Presentation.mp4?token=c_lJX9IvGx3_C9bIa9dGJBFQCK5KsuVZLO1IGe69m8A&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1103/v-short-1103_Presentation.vtt?token=R0Z-fEpj4ROmH5iNlsryGM_C4R2iRevQ-YyAiRs98ag&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Daniel Braun"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Example scatterplot shown to participants in our user study to investigate the differences between (a) visually estimating  and (b) visually validating the average value of the shown data.

We propose a compact visual representation that reveals periodicity by showing a phase histogram for a given period length that can be used standalone or in combination with other linked visualizations.

Diverse distortion measures have thus been proposed to evaluate the reliability of DR embeddings. However, implementing and executing distortion measures in practice has so far been time-consuming and tedious. To address this issue, we present ZADU, a Python library that provides distortion measures. ZADU is not only easy to install and execute but also enables comprehensive evaluation of DR embeddings through three key features. First, the library covers a wide range of distortion measures. Second, it automatically optimizes the execution of distortion measures, substantially reducing the running time required to execute multiple measures. Last, the library informs how individual points contribute to the overall distortions, facilitating the detailed analysis of DR embeddings. By simulating a real-world scenario of optimizing DR embeddings, we verify that our optimization scheme substantially reduces the time required to execute distortion measures. Finally, as an application of ZADU, we present another library called ZADUVis that allows users to easily create distortion visualizations that depict the extent to which each region of an embedding suffers from distortions.","authors":["Hyeon Jeon","Aeri Cho","Jinhwa Jang","Soohyun Lee","Jake Hyun","Hyung-Kwon Ko","Jaemin Jo","Jinwook Seo"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1036/v-short-1036_Preview.mp4?token=-Q_9nuDE1qnXJDv5cI9Z0mVudJR0dQh2nGJJvfJ4Xb8&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1036/v-short-1036_Preview.vtt?token=dP2FaU4Vgxol9QXKTiEBFOAT_q-U3NOkCCOFKNr001Q&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1036/v-short-1036_Presentation.mp4?token=T4Y02k3R_NkTZhPXweboG9sIeo4P_WHDrcRD0CI6dJg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1036/v-short-1036_Presentation.vtt?token=FkgvvQqPEdXsfjGD0gLvy-mMInTOOo2OD8BZrx9e4ww&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Aeri Cho"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The UMAP embedding of the MNIST dataset (leftmost column), and two distortion visualizations generated by ZADUVis: CheckViz and the Reliability Map.","keywords":["Dimensionality reduction, Reliability, Visualization Library, Distortion measures, Distortion visualizations"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","session_id":"short1","slot_id":"v-short-1036","time_end":"2023-10-26T03:54:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T03:45:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T03:45:00Z","title":"ZADU: A Python Library for Evaluating the Reliability of Dimensionality Reduction Embeddings","uid":"v-short-1036","youtube_ff_id":"p7t4tcFMGkc","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/p7t4tcFMGkc","youtube_prerecorded_id":"c2JvnAg1ZiQ","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/c2JvnAg1ZiQ"},{"abstract":"When exploring time series datasets, analysts often pose \"which and when\" questions.

One such widely used method is the interview --- researchers asking participants specific questions to enrich their understanding. In this work, we introduce the pair-interview technique as a method that relies on two interviewers with specific and delineated roles, instead of one. Pair-interviewing focuses on the mechanics of conducting semi-structured interviews as a pair, and complements other existing visualization interview techniques. Based on a synthesis of the experiences and reflections of researchers in four diverse studies who used pair-interviewing, we outline recommendations for when and how to use pair-interviewing within visualization research studies.","authors":["derya akbaba","Miriah Meyer"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1159/v-short-1159_Preview.mp4?token=L4p9sp27R3ID--kDzF7TICfi8tCQNxIF8iBgA_HuHr4&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1159/v-short-1159_Preview.vtt?token=qTgS1nB2wgacR80mq46J3dEcrdSFRvbqW8eHMvUrjdg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1159/v-short-1159_Presentation.mp4?token=nsrNDLaW0FXH36j4E7dIpbf9_G63l0e_acLFT7g1U28&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1159/v-short-1159_Presentation.vtt?token=ppql2HudkUKIi44S_FgpgAKuwkHV-4AfIo0h4eSuNIU&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Derya Akbaba"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This technique is not just for dinosaurs!

Two recent techniques, Surprise metrics and Value Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs), offer promising solutions but have yet to be tested empirically with users of visualizations. In this paper, we explore how well people can make use of these techniques in map exploration tasks. We report a crowdsourced experiment where n = 300 participants are assigned to one of Choropleth, Surprise (only), and VSUP conditions (depicting rates and Surprise in a suppressed palette). Results show clear differences in map analysis outcomes, e.g. with Surprise maps leading people to significantly higher areas of population, or VSUPs performing similar or better than Choropleths for rate selection. Qualitative analysis suggests that many participants may only consider a subset of the metrics presented to them during exploration and decision-making. We discuss how these results generally support the use of Surprise and VSUP techniques in practice, and opportunities for further technique development.

However, its physical nature limits efficiency and scalability. One potential solution to address this issue is autocomplete. By providing automated suggestions while still allowing for manual intervention, autocomplete can expedite visualization construction while maintaining expressivity. We conduct a speculative design study to examine how people would like to interact with a visualization authoring system that supports autocomplete. Our study identifies three types of autocomplete strategies and gains insights for designing future visualization authoring tools with autocomplete functionality.

We introduce Indy Survey Tool to help authors develop companion websites for survey papers across diverse fields of study. The tool\u2019s core aim is to identify correlations between categorizations of papers. To accomplish this, the tool offers multiple combined filters and correlation matrix visualizations that enable users to explore the data from diverse perspectives. The tool\u2019s visualizations, list of papers, and filters are harmoniously integrated and highly responsive, providing users with feedback based on their selections. Identifying correlations in survey papers is a pivotal aspect of research, as it can enable the recognition of common combinations of categorizations within the papers\u2014as well as highlight any omissions. The versatility of Indy Survey Tool enables researchers to delve into the correlations between categorizations in survey data, an essential aspect of research that can reveal gaps in the literature and highlight promising areas for future exploration.

Particle flow maps have become a popular means for communicating the speed and direction of wind in engaging and informative ways. Yet there is little empirical design guidance supporting the multiple encodings these maps use, such as particle speed, particle density, and color saturation. In this paper, we investigate multiple encoding wind maps using a staircase methodology to estimate just-noticeable differences for a range of speed values across visualizations with or without motion encodings. Results suggest: 1. the multiple encodings designers use are not only aesthetically engaging\u2013 they also improve speed discriminability for the average participant. 2. The speed of particle motion should be controlled under a certain range for good information retrieval accuracy. These findings contribute empirical guidance for particle motion encoding design, and lay groundwork for future investigations as motion becomes more widely used in visualization practice.","authors":["Yiren Ding","Lane Harrison"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1195/v-short-1195_Preview.mp4?token=KH8tNiOGUQmHYkrLs-iwvoNC3hABWrxFvB-dMacDus8&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1195/v-short-1195_Preview.vtt?token=nvdyVFaCKoYSWU86cXCpqsTeDF7Qc1agIHOJh-hoPMA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1195/v-short-1195_Presentation.mp4?token=Ktf4o8K8H4KLYqeaQ9tLuud4uynY85jSMFrRdcZosTE&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1195/v-short-1195_Presentation.vtt?token=gbCddZrHGGHiRWXsJrTChjxyFtUI1V9uUitEEZb4oQY&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Yiren Ding"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This study explores the use of motion in data visualizations, particularly in particle flow maps for representing wind speed and direction.

To better understand the interplay between concepts that describe visual features and the semantic relationships among those concepts (e.g., 'sharp increase' vs. 'gradual rise'), we conducted a crowdsourced study to collect labels and visual feature pairs for univariate line charts. Using this crowdsourced dataset of labeled visual signatures, this paper proposes a novel method for labeling visual chart features based on combining feature-word distributions with the visual features and the data domain of the charts. These feature-word-topic models identify word associations with similar yet subtle differences in semantics, such as 'flat,' 'plateau,' and 'stagnant,' and descriptors of the visual features, such as 'sharp increase,' 'slow climb,' and 'peak.' Our feature-word-topic model is computed using both a quantified semantics approach and a signal processing-inspired least-errors shape-similarity approach.

Although saliency maps are typically employed to locate attractive regions in still images, such scalar features do not express the trajectory of an observer's gaze. In this study, we propose a method for the visual analysis and approximate identification of leading lines based on maximum graphs, sparse subsets of Morse--Smale complexes, extracted from saliency maps.

When visualization designs match observer expectations, visualizations are easier to interpret. Prior work suggests that several factors influence such expectations. For example, the dark-is-more bias leads observers to infer that darker colors map to larger quantities, and the opaque-is-more bias leads them to infer that regions appearing more opaque (given the background color) map to larger quantities. Previous work suggested that the background color only plays a role if visualizations appear to vary in opacity. The present study challenges this claim. We hypothesized that the background color would modulate inferred mappings for colormaps that should not appear to vary in opacity (by previous measures) if the visualization appeared to have a \u201chole\u201d that revealed the background behind the map (hole hypothesis). We found that spatial aspects of the map contributed to inferred mappings, though the effects were inconsistent with the hole hypothesis. Our work raises new questions about how spatial distributions of data influence color semantics in colormap data visualizations.","authors":["Clementine Zimnicki","Chin Tseng","Danielle Albers Szafir","Karen Schloss"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1162/v-short-1162_Preview.mp4?token=H0QyNxmK6rvCUn1c2RQP3YEsGnQWEu2q08J9-Lgmmu8&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1162/v-short-1162_Preview.vtt?token=q_i3hYIxa1FH3U55VFurvRBCy34cfBPEDoTLg5s7br0&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1162/v-short-1162_Presentation.mp4?token=7tPEODfad7UETvr7sZV5QVUJ_ij221XTeUMBzgKE-GM&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1162/v-short-1162_Presentation.vtt?token=gd8c4d75580nH0QejP8kLsju3-e-kT3XVfBlsipUP6g&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Clementine Zimnicki"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"An image of 80 square colormap visualizations in 20 columns and 4 rows.

However, tactile encodings differed from their visual counterparts in terms of how accurately values could be decoded from them.

To facilitate efficient visualization of large datasets, downsampling has emerged as a well-established approach. This work concentrates on LTTB (Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets), a widely adopted downsampling algorithm for time series data point selection. Specifically, we introduce MinMaxLTTB, a two-step algorithm that significantly improves the scalability of LTTB. MinMaxLTTB consists of the following two steps: (i) the MinMax algorithm preselects a certain ratio of minimum and maximum data points, followed by (ii) applying the LTTB algorithm on only these preselected data points, effectively reducing LTTB\u2019s time complexity. The MinMax algorithm is computationally efficient and can be parallelized, enabling efficient data point preselection. Additionally, MinMax demonstrates competitive performance in terms of visual representation, making it also an effective data reduction method. Experimental results demonstrate that MinMaxLTTB outperforms LTTB by more than an order of magnitude in terms of computation time. Furthermore, preselecting a small multiple of the desired output size already yields similar visual representativeness compared to LTTB. In summary, MinMaxLTTB leverages the computational efficiency of MinMax to scale LTTB, without compromising on LTTB its favorable visualization properties.

We then conduct two studies investigating these factors' relationship with visualization design features. In the first study, participants' credibility, understanding, and reliability ratings depended on the visualization design and its source. In the second study, we find these factors also align with subjective trust rankings.

Visualizing ray intersections in these data structures is challenging due to the large number of queries in typical image rendering workloads, the spatial clutter induced by superimposing the tree in a 3D viewport, and the strong tendency of these queries to visit several tree leaves, all of which add a very high dimensionality to the data being visualized. We present a new technique for visualizing ray intersection traversals on BVHs over triangle meshes. Unlike previous approaches which display aggregate traversal costs using a heatmap over the rendered image, we display detailed traversal information about individual queries, using a 3D view of the mesh, a treemap of the BVH, and synchronized highlighting between the two views, along with a pixel grid to select a ray intersection query to view. We demonstrate how this technique elucidates traversal dynamics and tree construction properties, which makes it possible to easily spot algorithmic improvements in these two categories.","authors":["Abhishek Madan","Carolina Nobre"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1057/v-short-1057_Preview.mp4?token=WLiuLYxU_WiuT1iRRC4VsNH6vwH0tNDSx1MBBAlvnmo&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1057/v-short-1057_Preview.vtt?token=rC__EsrxmDAq5d_ueLtJA6IKS87NQZDszqxLDkvEYYg&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1057/v-short-1057_Presentation.mp4?token=V4MlikpELHnc_xfiZD87DSAEdfRqZ-yzKmG8dYjSKrI&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1057/v-short-1057_Presentation.vtt?token=YtOHYMy6ew0QlqQY91QmLFiWAdASyVbIaJG3hTafLXo&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Abhishek Madan"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"An annotated screenshot of our visualization, containing a 3D viewport, a zoomable treemap, and a pixel grid.

Recently, the concept of level set extraction has been extended to bivariate scalar fields. Prior work on vector field equivalence, wherein an analyst marks a region in the domain and is shown other regions in the domain with similar vector values, pointed out the need to make this extraction operation fast, so that analysts can work interactively. To date, the fast extraction of level sets from bivariate scalar fields has not been researched as extensively as for the univariate case. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that extracts fiber lines, i.e., the preimages of so called control polygons (FSCP), for bivariate 2D data by joint traversal of bounding volume hierarchies for both grid and FSCP elements. We performed an extensive evaluation, comparing our method to a two-dimensional adaptation of the method proposed by Klacansky et al., as well as to the naive approach for fiber line extraction. The evaluation incorporates a vast array of configurations in several datasets. We found that our method provides a speedup of several orders of magnitudes compared to the naive algorithm and requires two thirds of the computation time compared to Klacansky et al. adapted for 2D.","authors":["Felix Raith","Baldwin Nsonga","Gerik Scheuermann","Christian Heine"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1154/v-short-1154_Preview.mp4?token=NPN3qCsbiZ1-LyCFatfskEC3gMW6Vs1jytQlQyZXAJk&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1154/v-short-1154_Preview.vtt?token=ddSiZjM_khxDrZIW7OjSVxfw2kMdAUJXzgwJ8FiX9JA&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1154/v-short-1154_Presentation.mp4?token=1UA6HuhYrEXjaOqg9zKkjw6LoGM14J3Tf7Pk-n954VY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1154/v-short-1154_Presentation.vtt?token=zvqAA-I2zF2L4L9ObZMJlkXutwofQoWEZeuF56KWXFo&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Felix Raith"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":["Visualization, scalar fields, bivariate data, fibers, preimage extraction algorithm, dual bounding volume hierarchy traversal"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","session_id":"short4","slot_id":"v-short-1154","time_end":"2023-10-25T03:27:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-25T03:18:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-25T03:18:00Z","title":"Fast Fiber Line Extraction for 2D Bivariate Scalar Fields","uid":"v-short-1154","youtube_ff_id":"WfTz5SKGDt4","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/WfTz5SKGDt4","youtube_prerecorded_id":"fVnIv4YFG5I","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/fVnIv4YFG5I"},{"abstract":"Visualizing a scholar's scientific impact is important for many challenging tasks in academia such as tenure evaluation and award selection.

The visualization techniques commonly used in clinical routine for the exploration of complex cardiac data are based on multi-planar reformations, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering, which rely on basic lighting models prone to image distortion. On the other hand, cinematic rendering (CR), a three-dimensional visualization technique based on physically-based rendering methods, can create volumetric images with high fidelity. However, there are a lot of parameters involved in CR that affect the visualization results, thus being dependent on the user's experience and requiring detailed evaluation protocols to compare available solutions. In this study, we have analyzed the impact of the most relevant parameters in a CR pipeline developed in the open-source version of the MeVisLab framework for the visualization of the heart anatomy of three congenital patients and two adults from CT images. The resulting visualizations were compared to a commercial tool used in the clinics with a questionnaire filled in by clinical users, providing similar definitions of structures, depth perception, texture appearance, realism, and diagnostic ability.","authors":["Irum Baseer","Israel Valverde","Abdel H.

Our work is focused on modern vision-based generative adversarial networks (GAN), and their learned latent spaces, wherein concept discovery has gained significant interest as a means of image manipulation. Concept Lens is designed to support users in understanding the diversity of a pro- vided set of concepts, the relationship between concepts, and the suitability of concepts to give semantic controls for image genera- tion. Key to our approach is the hierarchical grouping of concepts, generated images, and the associated joint exploration.

They play a vital role in modulating Earth\u2019s radiation budget and driving regional changes in temperature and precipitation. This makes clouds ideal for climate intervention techniques like Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB) which refers to modification in cloud reflectivity, thereby cooling the surrounding region. However, to avoid unintended effects of MCB, we need a better understanding of the complex cloud to climate response function. Designing and testing such interventions scenarios with conventional Earth System Models is computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose a hybrid AI-assisted visual analysis framework to drive such scientific studies and facilitate interactive what-if investigation of different MCB intervention scenarios to assess their intended and unintended impacts on climate patterns. We work with a team of climate scientists to develop a suite of hybrid AI models emulating cloud-climate response function and design a tightly coupled frontend interactive visual analysis system to perform different MCB intervention experiments.","authors":["Subhashis Hazarika","Haruki Hirasawa","Sookyung Kim","Kalai Ramea","Salva R\u00fchling Cachay","Peetak Mitra","Dipti Hingmire","Hansi Singh","Phil Rasch"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1065/v-short-1065_Preview.mp4?token=7E12-0YRnGge3ntynudlfONDtbjHg08yrHplmh_EeBU&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1065/v-short-1065_Preview.vtt?token=HUMOWWit6YeWU-k1Y6Skbzo9pvs0AmKWJzs1DFSli3E&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1065/v-short-1065_Presentation.mp4?token=evre508d_gYuq8vdkRSbY-VGvGqMUM4LWtr5U8FQzzw&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1065/v-short-1065_Presentation.vtt?token=XoPlpshFtt1aYV-p0WQ1zOE_V-RbRFghdldlKa1ql7k&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Subhashis Hazarika"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"HAiVA is a Hybrid AI-assisted Visual Analysis Framework to Study the Effects of Cloud Properties on Climate Patterns.

Their abstract nature, however, can make it difficult for researchers to visualize the data they provide. Mobile sensing rarely invents practical tools to experiment with this mathematical method. Since visualization effectively communicates data findings, we develop an open-source, real-time app, Wuda, that allows users to observe the orientation of smart devices via inertial sensing.

However, this extra neural network prediction information is challenging to scalably convey visually for arbitrary data sources under multiple uncertainty contexts. To address these challenges, we present ScatterUQ, an interactive system that provides targeted visualizations to allow users to better understand model performance in context-driven uncertainty settings. ScatterUQ leverages recent advances in distance-aware neural networks, together with dimensionality reduction techniques, to construct robust, 2-D scatter plots explaining why a model predicts a test example to be (1) in-distribution and of a particular class, (2) in-distribution but unsure of the class, and (3) out-of-distribution. ML consumers and engineers can visually compare the salient features of test samples with training examples through the use of a ``hover callback'' to understand model uncertainty performance and decide follow up courses of action.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of ScatterUQ to explain model uncertainty for a multiclass image classification on a distance-aware neural network trained on Fashion-MNIST and tested on Fashion-MNIST (in distribution) and MNIST digits (out of distribution), as well as a deep learning model for a cyber dataset.

A common way of achieving this is to compute the relevance of the data using degree of interest (DOI) functions, which apply a scenario-specific metric to quantify the data items according to their relevance to the users and their tasks. These DOI values can then be used to adjust the visual encoding through mechanisms like focus+context or information hiding. For datasets too large to be visualized at once, an alternative approach is to visualize it progressively in chunks, allowing analysts to reason about partial results and concluding their analysis much earlier than had they waited for all data. Combining the advantages of both approaches to tailor the visualization seems synergistic, yet, in practice turns out to be challenging, as DOI functions require the context of all data to produce useful values, requiring lengthy computations that break analysts\u2019 flow in progressive visualization. In this paper, we propose an approach for uniting DOI functions with progressive visualization. We first introduce a new model for quantifying the user interest in analysis scenarios where the data is only partially available, by computing the interest for available data and predicting it for the rest. We then propose regression trees for implementing this approach in practice and evaluate it in benchmarks. With DOI values now available for progressive visualization as well, our approach opens the door for tailoring the visualization of large datasets to the analysis task at interactive update rates.","authors":["Marius Hogr\u00e4fer","Dominik Moritz","Adam Perer","Hans-J\u00f6rg Schulz"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1060/v-short-1060_Preview.mp4?token=oYfmzqNgkQFM47iSPRfuTeBKz_tLPALfewiKZTudR9s&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1060/v-short-1060_Preview.vtt?token=Bldh9PC4qTuCh-RqoxeMkuYNdGjaRDWqTpH2t3ubs3U&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1060/v-short-1060_Presentation.mp4?token=lZNjmNm7wUbwNp_XO1KJ4uoEgWScelS7-TYgpd68oso&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1060/v-short-1060_Presentation.vtt?token=2GxPHVSvJblowlIqWZE-4TV2RYAGLMIL_qwl3kY4TDk&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Marius Hogr\u00e4fer"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Our model that enables DOI functions on progressive visualization: Based on the current user interest, data that is deemed interesting gets retrieved from the database and integrated with the data already in the visualization, using the interest model to identify and update outdated interest values.","keywords":["Progressive visualization, degree-of-interest functions"],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","session_id":"short5","slot_id":"v-short-1060","time_end":"2023-10-26T23:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-26T23:03:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-26T23:03:00Z","title":"Combining Degree of Interest Functions and Progressive Visualization","uid":"v-short-1060","youtube_ff_id":"JCNuMnDb4d4","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/JCNuMnDb4d4","youtube_prerecorded_id":"79h2iTLwJ2w","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://youtu.be/79h2iTLwJ2w"}],"time_start":"2023-10-26T22:00:00Z","title":"Machine Learning / Language Models / Theory","track":"oneohfour","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""},{"chair":["Alfie Abdul-Rahman"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"104","discord_channel_id":"1161741240665124954","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741240665124954","event_prefix":"v-short","ff_link":"https://youtu.be/TpwSTq8WxrM","session_id":"short6","session_image":"short6.png","time_end":"2023-10-25T06:00:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"The diversity of genome-mapped data and analysis tasks makes it challenging for a single visualization tool to fulfill all visualization needs. To design a visualization tool that supports various genomics workflows of users, it is critical to first gain insights into the diverse workflows and the limitations of existing genomics tools for supporting them. In this paper, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=9) to understand the role of visualization in genomics data analysis workflows. Our main goals were to identify various genomics workflows, from data analysis to visual exploration and presentation, and to observe challenges that genomics analysts encounter in these workflows when using existing tools. Through the interviews, we found several unique characteristics of genomics workflows, such as the use of multiple visualization tools and many repetitive tasks, which can significantly affect the overall performance.

We followed a subjectivist case study approach and immersed ourselves in ongoing co-production activities over the course of one year, to capture how VA can support the dialogue between population health decision-makers and the communities they serve. We present a framework for Connecting Lived Experiences with Visualisation of Electronic Records (CLEVER). The framework regards visualisation as a central component in a complex adaptive decision-making ecosystem and highlights the need to structure domain knowledge across decision contexts in Population Health Management (PHM) at clinical-, service- and district-levels. Our process for developing an initial framework comprised three steps: (i) we elicited decision-making tasks through a series of qualitative data collection activities; (ii) we developed a preliminary domain model to capture data views and a subjective view of the world through human stories; and (iii) we developed a series of visualisation prototypes to instantiate the framework and demonstrated them regularly to stakeholders.

This is caused by the sensitivity of system to the process dynamics. As a result, a slight adjustment to a control parameter can significantly affect the efficiency of the system and thus impact the financial gain. Paper pulp production is an example of such a process, where operators continuously investigate the potential of changes in the process and predict the consequences of an adjustment before making a decision. Process parameter adjustments prescribed by simulated control models cannot be fully trusted as the external disturbances and the process inherent variabilities cannot be fully incorporated into the simulations. Therefore, to assess the viability of a strategy, operators often compare the situation with the historical records and trends during which the processes in the plant ran steadily. While previous research has mostly focused on developing advanced control models to simulate complex pulp production process, this work aims to support operators analytical reasoning by provision of effective data visualization. The contributions of our design study include a domain problem characterization and a linked-view visual encoding design, which aims to enhance operator's mental models independent of particular users or scenarios. Finally, by reflecting on the advantages of our choice of task abstraction technique, inherited from the ecological interface design framework [5], we reason for the generalizability of our approach to similar industrial applications.","authors":["Elmira Zohrevandi","Emmanuel Brorsson","Andreas Darnell","Magnus B\u00e5ng","Jonas Lundberg","Anders Ynnerman"],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1158/v-short-1158_Preview.mp4?token=Zz-G_pPAFIEnnaN2KApRIjP0PMrECF61vfKzFix3d7U&expires=1706590800","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1158/v-short-1158_Preview.vtt?token=IjvQaWDq0_AIrC93PFTg42i4p5Ukej9JRfqdTSYeESY&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1158/v-short-1158_Presentation.mp4?token=9bdDYafWp8sA9LwGH5X-joV_yLISuf9apE9-cQla06k&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/v-short/v-short-1158/v-short-1158_Presentation.vtt?token=IAjbiR108S_-qnR5jyYli9FM-LyJr8lbuHdu4bZD3jQ&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Emmanuel Brorsson"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"On the proposed focus+context linked-view interface, the topological view enables interaction with an ML classifier which visualizes the historical data that are most similar to the current situation.

Vis Futures is a card-based sketching game where players think critically (and playfully) about the future of data and visualization. Players deal a set of cards that hint at a possible future, and a possible dataset in that future. Players then use those prompts to imagine and sketch new visualization designs and imagine ways that future people from a particular audience might encounter, interact with, or utilize data (quirks and all). At the end of each round, players share their visualizations, discuss, and vote on which scenarios and visualizations are the most creative! Our goal is to include more people (including visualization students, researchers, and practitioners, as well as clients and collaborators) in discussions of critical data issues that have implications for the future of data, visualization, and technology. This game encourages players to engage in future-forward design thinking, examining the increasingly complex implications of our relationships with data and technology, and considering how, where, and why visual representations of data might play a role.

Drawing on Umberto Eco's ``Six Walks in the Fictional Woods'', we engender a speculative, transdisciplinary scientific narrative using ChatGPT in different roles: as an information repository, a ghost writer, a scientific coach, among others. The paper is written as a piling of plateaus where the titling of each (sub-)section, the ``teaser'' images, the headers, and a biblock of text are strata forming a narrative about narratives. To enrich our exposition, we present a visualization prototype to analyze storyboarded narratives, and extensive conversations with ChatGPT. Each link to a ChatGPT conversation is an experiment on writing where we try to use different plugins and techniques to investigate the topics that, ultimately form the content of this portable document file. Our visualization uses a dataset of stories with scene descriptions, textual descriptions of scenes (both generated by ChatGPT), and images (generated by Stable Diffusion using scene descriptions as prompts).

It brings together visualization researchers and practitioners from across the world to share new research and knowledge. Behind the scenes, a team of volunteers puts together the entire conference and makes sure it runs smoothly. Organizing involves logistics of the conference, ensuring that the attendees have an enjoyable time, allocating rooms to multiple concurrent tracks, and keeping the conference within budget. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly disrupted plans, forcing organizers to switch to virtual, hybrid, and satellite formats. These alternatives offer many benefits: fewer costs (e.g., travel, venue, institutional), greater accessibility (who can physically travel, who can get visas, who can get child care), and a lower carbon footprint (as people do not need to fly to attend). As many conferences begin to revert to the pre-pandemic status quo of primarily in-person conferences, we suggest that it is an opportune moment to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of lower-carbon conference formats. To learn more about the logistics of conference organizing, we talked to 6 senior executive-level VIS organizers. We review some of the many considerations that go into planning, particularly with regard to how they influence decisions about alternative formats. We aim to start a discussion about the sustainability of VIS -- including sustainability for finance, volunteers, and, central to this work, the environment -- for the next three years and the next three hundred years.","authors":["Elsie Lee-Robbins","Andrew M McNutt"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/w-altvis/w-altvis-1171/w-altvis-1171_Presentation.mp4?token=5H_KT0k9HEpQAk-6em18f6G9v0v1nMM2d9-zTYLF7Yo&expires=1706590800","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis23/w-altvis/w-altvis-1171/w-altvis-1171_Presentation.vtt?token=A8OZy5nDI2BhN4vO7YbfqSEBVHySQtAmJtUgEZG8n0U&expires=1706590800","contributors":["Elsie Lee-Robbins"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The IEEE VIS conference hosts more than a thousand participants, altogether flying thousands of miles, emitting thousands of kilograms of CO2 to attend.

This has profound influence on the way visualization is approached as the focus shifts away from any data-centric, visualization technique- or system-based foundations to one of human-centric visual perception, information perception, information acquisition and learning.  This paper reports on part of a design of a visualization approach and system for deployments in wide-scope application areas of interest and which is guided by the Engineering Insightful Serviceable Visualization (EISV) model and is thus in the context of this human-centric perspective. The application areas are primarily loosely constrained environments, that are, environments for which available techniques such as computational modeling or fixed, location-based sensors are ill-suited. These environments have terrain, build or other similar features. An aerial drone-based sensor platform is proposed to sample environmental data in these environments. One of the included sensors on this platform is a LiDAR, a distance ranging sensor.

To address this, we introduced a new assignment type: choose-your-own labs. In each lab, students implemented a visualization technique from that week\u2019s lecture.

Despite their expertise in journalism, journalists often encounter challenges in comprehending and utilizing novel visual representations or understanding data analysis methods. The main objective of the dAn-oNo learning environment is to guide journalists through the data analytics process by removing coding hurdles and allowing them to experiment with and understand the code. The learning environment utilizes a Jupyter notebook with Markdown sections and incorporates a step-by-step approach, covering various stages of the data analytics workflow, such as data importing, inspection, statistical analysis, and in-depth analysis.

Findings show that GPT-4 scored 80% on quizzes and homework, and Teaching Fellows could distinguish between GPT- and human-generated homework with 70% accuracy. The study also demonstrates GPT\u2019s potential in completing various visualization tasks, such as data cleanup, interaction with visualizations, and insight communication. The paper concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations of GPT in data visualization, potential avenues for incorporating GPT in broader visualization tasks, and the need to redesign visualization education.","authors":["Zhutian Chen","Chenyang Zhang","Qianwen Wang","Jakob Troidl","Simon Alexander Warchol","Johanna Beyer","Nils Gehlenborg","Hanspeter Pfister"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Zhutian Chen"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Our experiments show that GPT can a) clean and explore CSV datasets, b) read visualizations in SVG format, interact with visualizations through dispatching Javascript events, and c) create explanatory visualizations to present data insights.","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","session_id":"w11","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1011","time_end":"2023-10-23T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"Beyond Generating Code: Evaluating GPT on a Data Visualization Course","uid":"w-eduvis-1011","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"As the professional field of data visualization grows, so does the importance of preparing students effectively for the demands of real-world practice. Computing education has historically sought to teach and evaluate abstract knowledge (e.g., theories, principles, guidelines, design patterns) and the application of such knowledge to given problems. However, situations faced in professional practice are often messy, dynamic, and uncertain, and do not lend themselves well to the clear and direct application of such knowledge. This leaves a gap between the knowledge learned in the classroom and what is required for skillful practice in professional settings. In this paper, I discuss some historical reasons for this dominant pedagogical perspective, some of the core features of professional practice that are not typically taught in classrooms, and ways in which data visualization design can be taught to be more resonant with the experience of professional practice.","authors":["Paul Parsons"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Dr Paul Parsons"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","session_id":"w11","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1014","time_end":"2023-10-23T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"Preparing Future Data Visualization Designers for Professional Practice","uid":"w-eduvis-1014","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"Whilst the visual arts is a very practical and tangible field, data visualisation is a combination of programming skills, data science and design theory.

Traditional public engagement methods are often face-to-face, such as town halls, public forums, and workshops. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches were rendered ineffective due to health risks and the engagement process saw a shift towards virtual meetings. While accessible to a broader audience, virtual public meetings introduced challenges around limited time and opportunity for attendees to share feedback. Furthermore, attendees were often required to identify themselves, potentially discouraging reticent attendees from speaking up and risking confrontations with other attendees.

To provide an overview of the existing explanation methods and motivate researchers to design new approaches, we present a descriptive framework that connects data, features, tasks, and users involved in the word embedding explanation process. We use the framework as theoretical groundwork and implement a data processing pipeline that we use to solve three different tasks related to word embedding contextualization. These tasks enable answering questions about the encoded context properties in the embedding vectors, captured semantic concepts and their similarity, and masked-prediction meaningfulness and their relation to embedding characteristics.

Particularly, in the civic domain, analyzing and understanding the thoughts, opinions, and comments shared by the public on social media or online engagement platforms on various civic issues are crucial for tracking consensus and making informed policy decisions. However, the public inputs are often short, redundant, unstructured, and full of nuances and ambiguity with a lack of clear boundary between positive and negative stances, which demands significant time and effort to analyze. Coupled with a lack of guidelines to visualize short free-form text, designing visualizations to show meaningful insights from public input while preserving the context and semantic values remains a challenging task. In this work, we explored discourse acts as a fine-grained categorization to characterize public input beyond positive or negative stances. Furthermore, we applied McDonald's greedy approximation of global inference to prioritize the relevance and negate the redundancy present in the text. We integrated these approaches with an interactive prototype called Matryona that employs visualization techniques to provide a contextual summary of unstructured public input and enables multilayered exploration from different angles by controlling the information content. Our initial evaluation of the prototype suggests Matryona's potential for reducing ambiguity and eliciting nuances present in the short free-form text by using discourse acts and accelerating the analysis process by ranking text comments.","authors":["Mahmood Jasim","Mohit Iyyer","Narges Mahyar"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Narges Mahyar"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Matryona's detail view provides a dropdown to select discussions.

Here, we describe  how the extended persistent homology transform can be used to visualise, detect and quantify certain kinds of symmetry and discuss the effectiveness and limitations of this method.","authors":["Nicholas A Bermingham","Vanessa Robins","Katharine Turner"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Mr Nicholas A Bermingham"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","session_id":"w3","slot_id":"w-topoinvis-1007","time_end":"2023-10-22T06:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T03:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T03:00:00Z","title":"Planar Symmetry Detection and Quantification using the Extended Persistent Homology Transform","uid":"w-topoinvis-1007","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"This paper presents the first approach to visualize the importance of topological features that define classes of data. Topological features, with their ability to abstract the fundamental structure of complex data, are an integral component of visualization and analysis pipelines. Although not all topological features present in data are of equal importance. To date, the default definition of feature importance is often assumed and fixed. This work shows how proven explainable deep learning approaches can be adapted for use in topological classification. In doing so, it provides the first technique that illuminates what topological structures are important in each dataset in regards to their class label. In particular, the approach uses a learned metric classifier with a density estimator of the points of a persistence diagram as input. This metric learns how to reweigh this density such that classification accuracy is high. By extracting this weight, an importance field on persistent point density can be created. This provides an intuitive representation of persistence point importance that can be used to drive new visualizations. This work provides two examples: Visualization on each diagram directly and, in the case of sublevel set filtrations on images, directly on the images themselves. This work highlights real-world examples of this approach visualizing the important topological features in graph, 3D shape, and medical image data.","authors":["Yu Qin","Brittany Terese Fasy","Carola Wenk","Brian Summa"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Brian Summa"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"(a) A common task in topological data analysis: extracting a persistence diagram of topological features.

This allows us to build a field of importance for regions of a diagram. (c) This importance field can be used to create visualizations to illuminate which features drive a classification. For example, it can highlight what points are important directly in a diagram or, in the case of sublevel set filtrations, visualize the important structure directly in an image.

This paper focuses on the merge tree abstraction (representing the nesting of sub- or superlevel sets) and proposes the application of the unconstrained deformation-based edit distance. Previous approaches on merge trees often suffer from instability: small perturbations in the data can lead to large distances of the abstractions. While some existing methods can handle so-called vertical instability, the unconstrained deformation-based edit distance addresses both vertical and horizontal instabilities, also called saddle swaps. We establish the computational complexity as NP-complete, and provide an integer linear program formulation for computation. Experimental results on the TOSCA shape matching ensemble provide evidence for the stability of the proposed distance.

Established methods exist to locate and relate such points in a deterministic setting, but it is less well understood how the concept of critical points can be extended to the analysis of uncertain data. Most methods for this task aim at finding likely locations of critical points or estimate the probability of their occurrence locally but do not indicate if critical points at potentially different locations in different realizations of a stochastic process are manifestations of the same feature, which is required to characterize the spatial uncertainty of critical points. Previous work on relating critical points across different realizations reported challenges for interpreting the resulting spatial distribution of critical points but did not investigate the causes. In this work, we provide a mathematical formulation of the problem of finding critical points with spatial uncertainty and computing their spatial distribution, which leads us to the notion of uncertain critical points. We analyze the theoretical properties of these structures and highlight connections to existing works for special classes of uncertain fields. We derive conditions under which well-interpretable results can be obtained and discuss the implications of those restrictions for the field of visualization. We demonstrate that the discussed limitations are not purely academic but also arise in real-world data.","authors":["Dominik Vietinghoff","Michael B\u00f6ttinger","Gerik Scheuermann","Christian Heine"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Dominik Vietinghoff"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Set of critical points of the function x^2/10 + a*sin(x) is decomposed into connected components by poles (black lines) and degenerate critical points (gray lines) where the critical type changes.

In this work, we focus on tracking extrema of temporal scalar fields. A family of TDA approaches address this task by establishing one-to-one correspondences between extrema based on discrete gradient vector fields. More specifically, two extrema of subsequent time steps are matched if they fall into their respective ascending and descending manifolds. However, due to this one-to-one assignment, these approaches are prone to fail where, e.g., extrema are located in regions with low gradient magnitude, or are located close to boundaries of the manifolds. Therefore, we propose a probabilistic matching that captures a larger set of possible correspondences via neighborhood sampling, or by computing the overlap of the manifolds.

A set of high-dimensional vectors can be approximated via matrix sketching techniques such as principal component analysis and column subset selection. However, until now, there has not been any work on sketching a set of merge trees. We develop a framework for sketching a set of merge trees that combines matrix sketching with tools from optimal transport. In particular, we vectorize a set of merge trees into high-dimensional vectors while preserving their structures and structural relations. We demonstrate the applications of our framework in sketching merge trees that arise from time-varying scientific simulations.

Using F2Q, the questionnaires can be easily modified in case of changes to the law and regulations. These questionnaires serve as a virtual assistant to provide initial guidance to find answers to legal questions and, if needed, to direct the clients to a legal expert at the help center for further assistance. Most importantly, this efficient process could prevent potential clients from giving up their quest for justice due to a lack of awareness or inability to find the appropriate legal aid: when people do not know what questions to ask and where to seek answers, they give up and live with the injustice.

To combat this issue, methods that support serendipity has received attention in recent years that aim to provide information beyond a user's viewpoint or preference. However, the utility of systems that promote serendipity in raising awareness of opposing viewpoints remains underexplored, especially in the political context. To that end, we conducted a study where we asked 14 participants to explore tweets about two politically charged topics --- gun control and immigration --- using an interaction-driven visual analytics tool that visualizes users' exploration patterns and provides serendipitous suggestions from opposing viewpoints. We found that as participants explored the tweets, they gradually became aware of opposing viewpoints and identified information they did not consider before which helped them gain knowledge about arguments from all sides. We also found while people were keen to use technology that promotes serendipity to cover more topical information, they do not necessarily trust the information found on social media. We hope that our work will motivate future researchers to investigate serendipitous aspects in visualizations to promote a more holistic exploration of various viewpoints.","authors":["Mahmood Jasim, Mumtaz Fatima, Sagarika Ramesh Sonni, Narges Mahyar"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Narges Mahyar"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Serendyze enables several features for social media post exploration including a search option to look for a specific word, a set of filters corresponding to representative pairs of keywords, filters for social media posts with For, Against, and Neutral alignments, three exploration metrics - Visit, Coverage, and Distribution, all social media posts, and suggested social media posts generated by the bias mitigation model that the readers may find interesting.

Northcott provides supported accommodation services for people living in group homes (up to 6 people) with moderate to severe intellectual and physical disabilities requiring 24-hour support. Supported accommodation provides housing for marginalised and vulnerable people, often with limited resources. Working in this environment can be challenging but also rewarding. However, residents face even greater challenges because decisions made by others primarily determine their quality of life. These decision-makers can include family members or long-term support workers who have a deep understanding of the resident, allied health professionals who interact with the resident regularly but have a limited perspective, and government officials who lack a personal relationship with the resident but formulate policies that consequently have a profound effect on them. A significant issue for people with disability is the lack of visibility or understanding regarding how decisions affect their quality of life. To address this issue, the tool visualizes how decisions can restrict or enhance opportunities for people with disabilities. Additionally, it seeks to improve levels of communication by better expressing the will and preferences of the residents.","authors":["Georgina Hibberd, Jacqueline Lorber Kasunic, Kate Sweetapple"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Kate Sweetapple, Jacquie Lorber Kasunic"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The Good Life interactive visualisation tool","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","session_id":"w6","slot_id":"w-vis4good-3888","time_end":"2023-10-23T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"The Good Life: visualizing the complexity of supported living for people with disability","uid":"w-vis4good-3888","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"Data has transformative potential to empower people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD).

We argue that visualizations could be an equalizer for people with IDD to participate in data-driven conversations. Drawing on preliminary research findings and our experiences working with people with IDD and their data, we introduce and expand on the concept of cognitively accessible visualizations, unpack its meaning and roles in increasing IDD individuals' access to data, and discuss two immediate research objectives.

Although several solutions can be proposed such as translating English texts in visualization to other languages, there is little research that looks at the intersection of data visualization and different languages, and the implications that current visualization practices have on non-English speaking communities. In this position paper, we argue that linguistically diverse communities abound beyond the English-speaking world and offer a richness of experiences for the visualization research community to engage with. Through a case study of how two non-English languages interplay with data visualization reasoning in Madagascar, we describe how monolingualism in data visualization impacts the experiences of underrepresented populations and emphasize potential harm to these communities.

Sociodemographic data is a common part of datasets related to people, including institutional censuses, health data systems, and human-resources files. This data is sensitive, and its collection, sharing, and analysis require careful consideration. For instance, the European Union, through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), protects the collection and processing of any personal data, including sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religion. Data visualization of sociodemographic data can reinforce stereotypes, marginalize groups, and lead to biased decision-making. It is, therefore, critical that these visualizations are created based on good, equitable design principles. In this paper, we discuss and provide a set of open research questions around the visualization of sociodemographic data.

Prior work has identified that gender stereotypes can bias how recommenders describe female applicants compared to male applicants in contexts such as faculty positions and undergraduate research internships. For example, female applicants are more likely to be described as communal (e.g., affectionate, warm) while male applicants are more likely to be described as agentic (e.g., confident, intellectual). In this paper, we investigate the extent to which these differences in language affect readers' impression of applicant competitiveness and the efficacy of a mitigation strategy: visual highlighting.  Our findings suggest that simple changes in visual salience through highlighting language more commonly used to describe women can negatively affect readers' evaluation of candidates, while highlighting more language more commonly used to describe men can reduce the effects of the bias.","authors":["Yanan Da, Mengyu Chen, Ben Altschuler, Yutong Bu, Emily Wall"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yanan Da"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","session_id":"w6","slot_id":"w-vis4good-9528","time_end":"2023-10-23T01:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"Visual Salience to Mitigate Gender Bias in Recommendation Letters","uid":"w-vis4good-9528","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""}],"time_start":"2023-10-22T22:00:00Z","title":"Visualization for Social Good","track":"oneohfive","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""}]},"w-viscomm":{"event":"Sixth Workshop on Visualization for Communication (VisComm)","event_description":"","event_prefix":"w-viscomm","event_type":"workshop","event_url":"","long_name":"Sixth Workshop on Visualization for Communication (VisComm)","organizers":["Paul Parsons","Jon Schwabish","Alvitta Ottley","Alice Feng"],"sessions":[{"chair":["Paul Parsons","Jon Schwabish","Alvitta Ottley","Alice Feng"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"105","discord_channel_id":"1161741309346861067","discord_link":"https://discordapp.com/channels/1161400451619627068/1161741309346861067","event_prefix":"w-viscomm","ff_link":"","session_id":"w9","session_image":"w9.png","time_end":"2023-10-22T06:00:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"Aftershock forecasts can help reduce seismic risk by communicating how many aftershocks can be expected following a large earthquake, and how the expected number of aftershocks evolves over time and space.

In this exploratory study, we analyzed Twitter threads discussing visualization, aiming to uncover the beliefs and assumptions held by visualization designers. Utilizing 8 Twitter threads rich in discussion as case studies, we reveal the implicit assumptions that designers harbor while creating visualizations. If unaddressed, these assumptions often lead to confusion or misinterpretation. This paper discusses several strategies that designers can leverage to increase awareness about the assumptions they make. Though this study has limitations, given its reliance on inferred findings from self-reported Twitter data, it offers valuable insights for visualization design practitioners and proposes directions for future research.

Domain experts need to learn how to interpret complex data visualizations to gain insights. They often need help interpreting data visualizations as they are not part of their training. Integrating visualization onboarding concepts into visual analytics (VA) tools can support users in interpreting, reading, and extracting information from visual presentations. In this paper, we present the design of the onboarding concept for an interactive VA tool to analyze large scaled biological data, particularly high-throughput screening (HTS) data. We evaluated our onboarding design by conducting a cognitive walkthrough and interviews with thinking aloud. We also collected data on domain experts\u2019 visualization literacy. The results of the cognitive walkthrough showed that domain experts positively commented on the onboarding design and proposed adjusting smaller aspects. The interviews showed that domain experts are well-trained in interpreting basic visualizations (e.g., scatterplot, bar chart, line chart). However, they need support correctly interpreting the data visualized in the scatterplot, as they are new to them. Another important insight was fitting the onboarding messages into the domain\u2019s language.","authors":["Christina Stoiber, Daniela Moitzi, Holger Stitz, Dominic Girardi, Marc Streit, Wolfgang Aigner"],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Christina Stoiber"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"{\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\cocoartf2709 \\cocoatextscaling0\\cocoaplatform0{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss\\fcharset0 ArialMT;\\f1\\froman\\fcharset0 Times-Roman;} {\\colortbl;\\red255\\green255\\blue255;\\red0\\green0\\blue0;} {\\*\\expandedcolortbl;;\\cssrgb\\c0\\c0\\c0;} \\paperw11900\\paperh16840\\margl1440\\margr1440\\vieww11520\\viewh8400\\viewkind0 \\deftab720 \\pard\\pardeftab720\\sa320\\partightenfactor0  \\f0\\fs29\\fsmilli14667 \\cf0 \\expnd0\\expndtw0\\kerning0 \\outl0\\strokewidth0 \\strokec2 Onboarding navigation concept.
