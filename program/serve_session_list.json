For example, gene expression data at the molecular level needs to be interpreted based on cell type, spatial context, tissue type, and interactions with the surrounding environment.  Recent advances in spatial profiling technologies allow measurements of the level of thousands of proteins or genes at different spatial locations along with corresponding cellular composition. Representing such high dimensional data effectively to facilitate data interpretation is a major challenge. Existing methods such as spatially plotted pie or dot charts obscure underlying tissue regions and necessitate switching between different views for accurate interpretations. Here, we present TissuePlot, a novel method for visualizing spatial data at molecular, cellular and tissue levels in the context of their spatial locations. To this end, TissuePlot employs a transparent hexagon tessellation approach that utilizes object borders to represent cell composition or gene-level data without obscuring the underlying tissue image. Additionally, it offers a multi-view interactive web app, that allows interrogating spatial tissue data at multiple scales linking molecular information to tissue anatomy and motifs. We demonstrate TissuePlot utility using mouse brain data from the Bio+MedVis Redesign Challenge 2024.

Our design uses three linked views: a view of the histological image of the tissue, a stacked bar chart showing cell type proportions of the spots, and a scatter plot showing a dimensionality reduction of the multivariate proportions. Furthermore, we apply a compositional data analysis framework, the Aitchison geometry, to the proportions for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering. Leveraging brushing and linking, the system allows one to explore and uncover patterns in the cell type mixtures and relate them to their spatial locations on the cellular tissue.

In this, multiple cells are accumulated into pixels.  For each pixel the visualization should convey the prevalence and extent of cell types it is composed of, i.e., a proportional relation. The provided baseline technique of superimposed Pie charts -- a common technique for this kind of relation -- is not an ideal choice as the cell-type quantities of neighboring pixels are hard to compare due to a spatial disarray inherent to pie charts. This limits the perception of regions with coherent cell-type compositions, which constitutes one of the essential visual analytics tasks.  We propose a novel marker design: \\emph{Droplets} -- a space-saving design for visually enhancing the presence of clusters and regional borders. We evaluate this concept for the given tissue sample and compare it to the given baseline and other alternatives.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"email":"s.lengauer@cgv.tugraz.at","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Stefan Lengauer"},{"affiliations":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"email":"peter.waldert@cgv.tugraz.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Peter Waldert"},{"affiliations":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"email":"tobias.schreck@cgv.tugraz.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Schreck"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Stefan Lengauer"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"contest1","slot_id":"a-biomedchallenge-8493","time_end":"2024-10-13T19:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T16:00:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T16:00:00Z","title":"Droplets: A Marker Design for visually enhancing Local Cluster Association","uid":"a-biomedchallenge-8493","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6sxFyy5SXQ0?start=5553"},{"abstract":"Spatial transcriptomics methods capture cellular measurements such as gene expression and cell types at specific locations in a cell, helping provide a localized picture of tissue health.

Cuneiform signs are obtained by impressing a stylus on fresh clay tablets. For certain purposes, e.g. authentication by seal imprint, some cuneiform tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes, which cannot be opened without destroying them. The aim of our interdisciplinary project is the non-invasive study of clay tablets. A portable X-ray micro-CT scanner is developed to acquire density data of such artifacts on a high-resolution, regular 3D grid at collection sites. The resulting volume data is processed through feature-preserving denoising, extraction of high-accuracy surfaces using a manifold dual marching cubes algorithm and extraction of local features by enhanced curvature rendering and ambient occlusion. For the non-invasive study of cuneiform inscriptions, the tablet is virtually separated from its envelope by curvature-based segmentation. The computational- and data-intensive algorithms are optimized for near-real-time offline usage with limited resources at collection sites. To visualize the complexity-reduced and octree-based compressed representation of surfaces, we develop and implement an interactive application. To facilitate the analysis of such clay tablets, we implement shape-based feature extraction algorithms to enhance cuneiform recognition. Our workflow supports innovative 3D display and interaction techniques such as autostereoscopic displays and gesture control.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"stephan.olbrich@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stephan Olbrich"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Nanterre, France"],"email":"cecile.michel@cnrs.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"C\u00e9cile Michel"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christian.schroer@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christian Schroer"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"samaneh.ehteram@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Samaneh Ehteram"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.schropp@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Schropp"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"philipp.paetzold@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Philipp Paetzold"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Andreas Beckert"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Virtual unpacking of an ancient clay tablet enclosed in another layer of clay.

While DR methods are often applied to typical DR benchmark data sets in the literature, they might suffer from high runtime complexity and memory requirements, making them unsuitable for large data visualization especially in environments outside of high-performance computing. To perform DR on large data sets, we propose the use of out-of-sample extensions.Such extensions allow inserting new data into existing projections, which we leverage to iteratively project data into a reference projection that consists only of a small manageable subset. This process makes it possible to perform DR out-of-core on large data, which would otherwise not be possible due to memory and runtime limitations. For metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), we contribute an implementation with out-of-sample projection capability since typical software libraries do not support it. We provide an evaluation of the projection quality of five common DR algorithms (MDS, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and autoencoders) using quality metrics from the literature and analyze the trade-off between the size of the reference set and projection quality. The runtime behavior of the algorithms is also quantified with respect to reference set size, out-of-sample batch size, and dimensionality of the data sets. Furthermore, we compare the out-of-sample approach to other recently introduced DR methods, such as PaCMAP and TriMAP, which claim to handle larger data sets than traditional approaches. To showcase the usefulness of DR on this large scale, we contribute a use case where we analyze ensembles of streamlines amounting to one billion projected instances.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"lucareichmann01@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luca Marcel Reichmann"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"david.haegele@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David H\u00e4gele"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Weiskopf"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/a-ldav/a-ldav-1003/a-ldav-1003_Preview.mp4?token=PYJw_loXL4L1qAH_hlEUHMBLIR9img4Wuf2hw1VfGqw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/a-ldav/a-ldav-1003/a-ldav-1003_Preview.srt?token=wztCbEzC5jXSgn8_YRdZ6ycRd17DxhBRfIfdjynStm0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Luca Reichmann"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The projections show the results of dimensionality reduction using the out-of-sample approach with data sets containing up to 50 million data points.

For example, understanding climate simulations based on the long-term average of temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables is essential to predicting and establishing root causes of future undesirable scenarios and assessing possible mitigation strategies. Unfortunately, bottlenecks in petascale workflows restrict scientists' ability to analyze and visualize the necessary information due to requirements for extensive computational resources, obstacles in data accessibility, and inefficient analysis algorithms. This paper presents an approach to managing, visualizing, and analyzing petabytes of data within a browser on equipment ranging from the top NASA supercomputer to commodity hardware like a laptop. Our approach is based on a novel data fabric abstraction layer that allows querying scientific information in a form that is user-friendly while hiding the complexities of dealing with file systems or cloud services. We also optimize network utilization while streaming from petascale repositories through state-of-the-art progressive compression algorithms. Based on this abstraction, we provide customizable dashboards that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, offering straightforward access to vast amounts of data typically not available to those without access to uniquely expensive hardware resources. Our dashboards provide and improve the ability to access and, more importantly, use massive data for a wide range of users, from top scientists with access to leadership-class computing environments to undergraduate students of disadvantaged backgrounds from minority-serving institutions. We focus on NASA's use of petascale climate datasets as an example of particular societal impact and, therefore, a case where achieving equity in science participation is critical. In particular, we validate our approach by improving the ability of climate scientist to explore their data even on the top NASA supercomputer, introducing the ability to study their data in a fully interactive environment instead of being limited to using pre-choreographed videos that can take days to generate each. We also successfully introduced the same dashboards and simplified training material in an undergraduate class on Geospatial Analysis in a minority-serving campus (Utah State Banding) with 69% of the Native American students and 86% being low-income. The same dashboards are also released in simplified form to the general public, providing an unparalleled democratization for the access and use of climate data that can be extended to most scientific domains.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"aashishpanta0@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Aashish Panta"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"xuanhuang@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuan Huang"},{"affiliations":["NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, United States"],"email":"nina.mccurdy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nina McCurdy"},{"affiliations":["NASA, mountain View, United States"],"email":"david.ellsworth@nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Ellsworth"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"amy.a.gooch@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Amy Gooch"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"scrgiorgio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Giorgio Scorzelli"},{"affiliations":["NASA, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"hector.torres.gutierrez@jpl.nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hector Torres"},{"affiliations":["caltech, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"pklein@caltech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Patrice Klein"},{"affiliations":["Utah State University Blanding, Blanding, United States"],"email":"gustavo.ovando@usu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gustavo Ovando-Montejo"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"pascucci.valerio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Valerio Pascucci"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Aashish Panta"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We provide unprecedented equitable access to massive data via our novel data fabric abstraction enabled by dashboards on commodity desktop computers with a simple weblink for everyone from top NASA scientists to students in disadvantaged communities to the general public.

Our solution highlights the strengths of a multidirectional approach in data analytics, incorporating vessel information, fish origins, exported commodities, and shipping ports.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["West Lafayette Jr./Sr. High School, West Lafayette, United States"],"email":"ashleywqyang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ashley Yang"},{"affiliations":["Purdue University, WEST LAFAYETTE, United States"],"email":"wang5329@purdue.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hao Wang"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"yqq1960582321@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qianlai Yang"},{"affiliations":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, United States"],"email":"yang2767@purdue.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qi Yang"},{"affiliations":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, United States"],"email":"gong224@purdue.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ziqian Gong"},{"affiliations":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, United States"],"email":"zhou1471@purdue.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zizun Zhou"},{"affiliations":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, United States"],"email":"qianz@purdue.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhenyu Cheryl Qian"},{"affiliations":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, United States"],"email":"victorchen@purdue.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingjie Victor Chen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Hao Wang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"contest2","slot_id":"a-vast-challenge-1019","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"Purdue-Chen-MC2","uid":"a-vast-challenge-1019","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HhIQktS5HZs?start=5349"},{"abstract":"In this paper we present an interactive visualization system for solving IEEE VAST Challenge 2024 Mini-Challenge 1.

This highlights the need for rich and expressive data representations to communicate the science on which society rests and on which society must act. However, current visualization techniques often lack the broad visual vocabulary needed to accommodate the explosion in data scale, diversity and audience perspectives. While previous work has mined artistic and design knowledge for color maps and shape affordances (glyphs) in visualization, line encoding has received little attention. In this paper we report on an exploration of visual properties that extend the vocabulary of the line, particularly for categorical encoding. We describe the creation of a corpus of lines motivated by artistic practice, Gestalt theory, and design principles, and present initial results from a study of how different visual properties influence how people associate these into sets of similar lines. While very preliminary, the findings suggest that a rich set of line attributes will support both association and categorical hierarchies, as well as provoke further inquiry into how and why line encoding can be more expressive in encoding multivariate, multidimensional data.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States"],"email":"fsamsel@tacc.utexas.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Francesca Samsel"},{"affiliations":["Simon Fraser University, Surrey, Canada"],"email":"lyn@sfu.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lyn Bartram"},{"affiliations":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States"],"email":"gda@tacc.utexas.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Greg Abram"},{"affiliations":["University of Texas, Texas Advanced Computing Center, Austin, United States"],"email":"adb@tacc.utexas.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Anne Bowen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Francesca Samsel"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-1055","time_end":"2024-10-16T14:25:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:15:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T14:15:00Z","title":"What\u2019s My Line?

However, this paper highlights that current studies have neglected the media and philosophical dimensions, culminating in an interactive system named the 'Humanity Test.' \"Humanity\" refers to emotions and consciousness, while \"test\" signifies a critical study of AI technology and an exploration of the distinctions between humanity and technicality. Furthermore, based on a review of related literature, we argue that the focus of AI system research is shifting, with electroencephalogram (EEG) data becoming a trend in AI system integration. Collecting and analyzing experimental data, we identified three design directions: enhancing immersive experiences, creating emotional experiences, and expressing ideas. The experiment results indicate that integrating EEG data into AI systems markedly improves participants' immersive and emotional experiences. This integration not only promotes a deeper understanding of the human-machine boundary but also encourages empathic interactions among users. Based on these findings, EEG data as a medium shows a promising potential to enrich interactive experiences, providing new insights into integrating technology with human emotions.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"email":"373895198@qq.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fang Fang"},{"affiliations":["College of Design and Innovation, Shanghai, China"],"email":"tanhaogao@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tanhao Gao"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fang Fang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-1102","time_end":"2024-10-16T14:35:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:25:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T14:25:00Z","title":"Humanity Test - EEG Data Mediated Artificial Intelligence Multiplayer  Interactive System","uid":"a-visap-1102","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Francesca Samsel","Fang Fang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-pres3","time_end":"2024-10-16T14:50:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:35:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T14:35:00Z","title":"Q&A","uid":"","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cfrKwHQy8oU?start=4655"},{"abstract":"As advanced technology reshapes our perception, the dialogue between humans and the universe undergoes a transformative shift. Understanding this transformation can help us think about how humanity is headed in the future. To illustrate this dialogue shift, we propose the creation of a spatial art installation that embodies the revolution in dialogue. Drawing on interdisciplinary research and methodologies spanning anthropology, philosophy, astronomy, acoustics, computer science, and nomadic traditional singing, we embark on a transformative journey. Using artistic language, this work juxtaposes the most advanced astronomical observation practices of humanity with the ancient nomadic tradition of conversing with the cosmos. Specifically, it engages in a dialogue between the astronomical data from the James Webb Space Telescope and the throat-singing tradition of Khoomei. Subsequently, the work models the propagation of these sounds in three-dimensional space and materializes them into tangible entities. By immersing observers in the spatial representation of this dialogue, we offer a profound experience of evolving dialogue between human and the universe within the fluidity of spacetime.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"ywang342@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fiona You Wang"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"anijiati587@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Joshua Nijiati Alimujiang"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"wohinwu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Violet Wei Wu"},{"affiliations":["Washington University in St.Louis, St.Louis, United States"],"email":"liu.rose@wustl.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Rose Yiwei Liu"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"kzhangcma@hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kang Zhang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fiona You Wang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-1044","time_end":"2024-10-16T15:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:50:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T14:50:00Z","title":"Spacetime Dialogue: Integrating Astronomical Data and Khoomei in Spatial Installation","uid":"a-visap-1044","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"Data visualization is often associated with efficiency and the production of insights. However, visual artworks that utilize data as their artistic medium, often referred to as data art or artistic visualizations, receive less attention, especially in discussions surrounding exhibitions specifically focused on data visualization. Artistic visualization is typically presented and debated at conferences on data visualization and related areas in computing and design, usually involving an exhibition of works in parallel. While there are established exhibitions in electronic art, collective exhibitions focused on artistic data visualization, especially those independent of academic events, remain rare. Additionally, there is a limited amount of literature regarding the curatorial practice of specifically artistic data visualization exhibitions. This paper aims to contribute with the discussion of the curatorial processes behind two artistic data visualization exhibitions, Numerical Existence and Numerical Existence: Emergencies, held in Rio de Janeiro in 2018 and 2024, respectively. We will present a brief overview of curatorial at- tributes, identify the most common issues addressed in exhibitions dedicated to data visualization curated in artistic contexts, discuss the role and unique challenges of curatorial practice in this field, and share insights from our curatorial experience with two exhibitions. Furthermore, we will propose future directions for research and practice in the curation of artistic data visualization. Through this exploration, we aim to contribute to the curatorial practice of artistic data visualization, providing reflections and recommendations to enhance the development of this emerging field.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"email":"luiztorresludwig@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luiz Ludwig"},{"affiliations":["Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"email":"bcastro@esdi.uerj.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barbara Castro"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"email":"doriskos@eba.ufrj.br","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Doris Kosminsky"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Doris Kosminsky"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-1052","time_end":"2024-10-16T15:10:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T15:00:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T15:00:00Z","title":"Numerical Existence: Reflections on Curating Artistic Data Visualization Exhibitions","uid":"a-visap-1052","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fiona You Wang","Doris Kosminsky"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visap1","slot_id":"a-visap-pres4","time_end":"2024-10-16T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T15:10:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T15:10:00Z","title":"Q&A","uid":"","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cfrKwHQy8oU?start=4655"}],"time_start":"2024-10-16T14:15:00Z","title":"VISAP Papers","track":"bayshore3","youtube_id":"hN3g-SgPE4g","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/hN3g-SgPE4g","zoom_private_link":"https://ieeevis.zoom.us/j/82969780742?pwd=TAMjOKrKcTIGVpsbdnf2LLWS1YBAqv.1","zoom_private_meeting":"82969780742","zoom_private_password":"FZ0z1R"},{"chair":["Pedro Cruz","Rewa Wright","Rebecca Ruige Xu","Lori Jacques","Santiago Echeverry","Kate Terrado","Todd Linkner"],"discord_category":"","discord_channel":"bayshore-iii","discord_channel_id":"1286347478916137063","discord_link":"https://discord.com/channels/1286338967674818684/1286347478916137063","event_prefix":"a-visap","external_site":"https://visap.net/2024/","ff_link":"","room_name":"Bayshore III","session_id":"visap2","session_image":"visap2.png","slido_link":"https://app.sli.do/event/bmrgFqMKiACBaBFW8mudWp?section=db5276da-1832-4988-a289-3f940d3ff3fa","time_end":"2024-10-17T15:30:00Z","time_slots":[{"abstract":"This article introduces an artistic research project that utilises artist-in-residency and exhibition as methods for exploring the possibilities of robotic 3D printing and ceramics. The interdisciplinary project unites artists and architects to collaborate on a proposed curatorial concept and Do-It-With-Others (DIWO) technological development. Constraints include material, specifically local clay, production technique, namely 3D printing with a robotic arm, and kiln size, as well as an exhibition concept that is further elaborated in the next chapter.

Visualizing the metro, which is a visceral and accustomed part of the daily lived experience for residents, makes it reappear in residents' perspectives in a new form, becoming a more emblematic landscape of each city's unique identity and development. In this project, we introduce an abstraction method that encodes metro routes as lines, cities as squares, and the global map as an abstract representation. Along with the implementation of an interactive system, the project enables a comprehensive visual exploration of the global metro lines. Through this highly abstract and minimalist form, each city\u2019s structure, symbolic identity, and regional development are revealed. Moreover, the colorful global metro map efficiently portrays the diversity and evolution of metro lines worldwide.

Dr. Mary Steedly once described memories as a \"densely layered, sometimes conflictual negotiation with the passage of time\", and in 2022, over 50 million people faced this painful reality of memory loss due to Alzheimer's and related dementias. Yet, amidst this poignant backdrop, the emergence of text-to-image AI systems in 2022 offered a glimmer of new perspective, as they harnessed the power of language to imagine and reassemble fragmented memories, possibly to weave what time and disease had stolen.  \u200b When we coexist with machines, will we accumulate synthetic recollections of collective symbiotic imagination? Is language capable of re-weaving and synthesizing memories? How does our collective memory inspire new visual forms and alternative narratives?  Recollection is an assemblage of intimate human-machine artifacts that emphasizes the contributions from three sides: artists, machines, and participants. This customized AI application facilitates multiple AI techniques, like speech recognition, text auto-completion, and text-to-image, to convert language input into image sequences of new memories. As an interactive experience, participants will whisper their personal memories with fragmented sentences, and our system will automatically fill in details, creating new touching visual memories.  We developed our customized AI system by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer-based AI model to learn the documentaries of Alzheimer patients\u2019 visual memories and their descriptions. The system imagines new memories of \"love\" and \"loss\" by interpreting real-time narratives from participants in the installation. Our system emerges as a vibrant and inclusive conversation starter, transcending boundaries with support for over 89 different languages, embracing the diverse cultural artifacts.   In the art installation, we chose not to showcase the direct visual output generated by our AI system. Instead, we drew inspiration from fine-art practices such as the Monotype, a printmaking technique tracing its origins to the 1640s, and slitscan photography, known for capturing sequential slices of a subject over time. We aimed to present ReCollection by combining generative methodologies with fine-art practices, investigating new aesthetics that explore the fleeting visual imagery, undergoing dissolution, tilting, printing, and reprinting over time.  By providing a conceptual framework for non-linear narratives, which constitute symbiotic imaginations, and future scenarios of memories, culture production, and reproductions. It may inspire the cure for memory regression by providing a future scenario, a thought experiment, and an intimate recollection of symbiosis between beings and apparatus. It raises people's awareness of future memory preservation and their empathy for the dementia community through a personalized aesthetic experience. It offers an artistic approach and future prototype for cultural heritage reproduction and re-imagination and explores the tensions that exist in the co-relations between visual representations, language, and narratives.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Arizona State University, Tempe, United States"],"email":"weidizhang@ucsb.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"weidi zhang"},{"affiliations":["Independant Researcher, Beijing, China"],"email":"jieliang@ucsb.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jieliang Luo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["weidi zhang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"visapr","slot_id":"a-visap-1079","time_end":"2024-10-15T21:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-15T20:15:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-15T20:15:00Z","title":"ReCollection","uid":"a-visap-1079","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"Our work builds on the study of notational systems in the context of rap music and offers rich insights into the complexities of language, culture, and expression in a postcolonial culture.

face increasing mobility demands. Yet, many public transport networks struggle to meet diverse user needs due to historical development, urban constraints, and financial limitations. Traditionally, planning of transport network structure is often based on limited surveys, expert opinions, or partial usage statistics. This provides an incomplete basis for decision-making. We introduce an data-driven approach to public transport planning and optimization, calculating detailed accessibility measures at the individual housing level. Our visual analytics workflow combines population-group-based simulations with dynamic infrastructure analysis, utilizing a scenario-based model to simulate daily travel patterns of varied demographic groups, including schoolchildren, students, workers, and pensioners. These population groups, each with unique mobility requirements and routines, interact with the transport system under different scenarios traveling to and from Points of Interest (POI), assessed through travel time calculations. Results are visualized through heatmaps, density maps, and network overlays, as well as detailed statistics. Our system allows us to analyze both the underlying data and simulation results on multiple levels of granularity, delivering both broad insights and granular details. Case studies with the city of Konstanz, Germany reveal key areas where public transport does not meet specific needs, confirmed through a formative user study. Due to the high cost of changing legacy networks, our analysis facilitates the identification of strategic enhancements, such as optimized schedules or rerouting, and few targeted stop relocations, highlighting consequential variations in accessibility to pinpointing critical service gaps. Our research advances urban transport analytics by providing policymakers and citizens with a system that delivers both broad insights with granular detail into public transport services for a data-driven quality assessment at housing-level detail.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"yannick.metz@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yannick Metz"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"dennis-fabian.ackermann@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dennis Ackermann"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"keim@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Keim"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"max.fischer@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Maximilian T.

It synthesizes perspectives from Automated Data Science (AutoDS) and Interactive Data Visualization (VIS), which traditionally represent opposing ends of the human-machine spectrum. While AutoDS aims to enhance efficiency by reducing human tasks, VIS emphasizes the importance of nuanced understanding, innovation, and context provided by human involvement. This paper examines these dichotomies through an online survey and advocates for a balanced approach that harmonizes the efficiency of automation with the irreplaceable insights of human expertise. Ultimately, we address the essential question of not just what we can automate, but what we should automate, seeking strategies that prioritize technological advancement alongside the fundamental need for human oversight.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Boston, United States"],"email":"jen@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jen Rogers"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, INRIA, Orsay, France"],"email":"mehdi.chakhchoukh@universite-paris-saclay.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mehdi Chakhchoukh"},{"affiliations":["Leiden Universiteit, Leiden, Netherlands"],"email":"anastacio@aim.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marie Anastacio"},{"affiliations":["Tulane University, New Orleans, United States"],"email":"rfaust1@tulane.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Rebecca Faust"},{"affiliations":["University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom"],"email":"cagatay.turkay@warwick.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Cagatay Turkay"},{"affiliations":["University of Wyoming, Laramie, United States"],"email":"larsko@uwyo.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lars Kotthoff"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"steffen.koch@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Steffen Koch"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"andreas.kerren@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Kerren"},{"affiliations":["University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"email":"bernard@ifi.uzh.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"J\u00fcrgen Bernard"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1002/s-vds-1002_Preview.mp4?token=95WeM8irbKnh9Du-lE9XJTq36pdxWIujIGgIGk3Z1n4&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1002/s-vds-1002_Preview.srt?token=8fssMCCBdK9YKDz1Yu5pDc-mAEXHleiX_h-nOSWcRrc&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Jen Rogers"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The tug-of-war between automation and human involvement in data science: As automation technology advances, the balance between human intuition and machine efficiency becomes increasingly critical.

We present a novel dimensionality reduction-based visualization for categorical data, which is based on defining the distance of two data items as the number of varying attributes. Our technique enables users to pre-attentively detect groups of similar data items and observe the properties of the projection, such as attributes strongly influencing the embedding. Our prototype visually encodes data properties in an enhanced scatterplot-like visualization, visualizing attributes in the background to show the distribution of categories. In addition, we propose two graph-based measures to quantify the plot's visual quality, which rank attributes according to their contribution to cluster cohesion. To demonstrate the capabilities of our similarity-based projection method, we compare it to Euler diagrams and Parallel Sets regarding visual scalability and evaluate it quantitatively on seven real-world datasets using a range of common quality measures. Further, we validate the benefits of our approach through an expert study with five data scientists analyzing the Titanic and Mushroom dataset with up to 23 attributes and 8124 category combinations. Our results indicate that our Categorical Data Map offers an effective analysis method for large datasets with a high number of category combinations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"frederik.dennig@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Frederik L.

Despite their widespread use, these systems often suffer from algorithmic biases that can lead to unfair and unsatisfactory user experiences. This study introduces an interactive tool designed to help users comprehend and explore the impacts of algorithmic harms in recommender systems. By leveraging visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and interactive modules, the tool allows users to investigate how biases such as miscalibration, stereotypes, and filter bubbles affect their recommendations. Informed by in-depth user interviews, both general users and researchers can benefit from increased transparency and personalized impact assessments, ultimately fostering a better understanding of algorithmic biases and contributing to more equitable recommendation outcomes. This work provides valuable insights for future research and practical applications in mitigating bias and enhancing fairness in machine learning algorithms.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"yongsu.ahn@pitt.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yongsu Ahn"},{"affiliations":["School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"quinnkwolter@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quinn K Wolter"},{"affiliations":["Quest Diagnostics, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"jonilyndick@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jonilyn Dick"},{"affiliations":["Quest Diagnostics, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"janetad99@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Janet Dick"},{"affiliations":["University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"yurulin@pitt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yu-Ru Lin"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1021/s-vds-1021_Preview.mp4?token=Gd9gotKCklMf66hdSrwI7pFZqqLfFnl_iLa5KU-lz50&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1021/s-vds-1021_Preview.srt?token=XCnK0MnML8SnYP-fJnKGuB59POVVoqT0E1qUtcyFcQA&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yongsu Ahn"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"associated5","slot_id":"s-vds-1021","time_end":"2024-10-13T18:05:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T17:55:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T17:55:00Z","title":"Interactive Counterfactual Exploration of Algorithmic Harms in Recommender Systems","uid":"s-vds-1021","youtube_ff_id":"Q4PRivOX2CQ","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/Q4PRivOX2CQ","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"This position paper discusses the profound impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on semantic change, emphasizing the need for comprehensive monitoring and visualization techniques. Building on established concepts from linguistics, we examine the interdependency between mental and language models, discussing how LLMs influence and are influenced by human cognition and societal context. We introduce three primary theories to conceptualize such influences: Recontextualization, Standardization, and Semantic Dementia, illustrating how LLMs drive, standardize, and potentially degrade language semantics.Our subsequent review categorizes methods for visualizing semantic change into frequency-based, embedding-based, and context-based techniques, being first in assessing their effectiveness in capturing linguistic evolution: Embedding-based methods are highlighted as crucial for a detailed semantic analysis, reflecting both broad trends and specific linguistic changes. We underscore the need for novel visual, interactive tools to monitor and explain semantic changes induced by LLMs, ensuring the preservation of linguistic diversity and mitigating linguistic biases. This work provides essential insights for future research on semantic change visualization and the dynamic nature of language evolution in the times of LLMs.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"raphael.buchmueller@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Raphael Buchm\u00fcller"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"friederike.koerte@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Friederike K\u00f6rte"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"keim@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Keim"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1029/s-vds-1029_Preview.mp4?token=t9ktK8xhtnb0aavzIMa18Y4uVFntG62g5EOSZEZ1gfE&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1029/s-vds-1029_Preview.srt?token=PAuO0koDnAkjI8Xm8CFJWMVlQws48T_83jbrIiX_mHU&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Raphael Buchm\u00fcller"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Hi, and thanks for joining.

This approach not only aids in understanding complex datasets but also enhances decision-making in various applications, from academic course planning to complex scenarios like ensemble forecasting and gene mapping.","keywords":["Uncertainty, Data Visualization, Measurement Uncertainty, Visual Analytics, Terminology, Task Analysis, Surveys, Conceptual Framework, Cardinality, Data Visualization, Visual Representation, Measure Of The Amount, Set Membership, Intersection Set, Visual Design, Different Types Of Uncertainty, Missing Values, Visual Methods, Fuzzy Set, Age Of Students, Color Values, Uncertainty Values, Explicit Representation, Aggregate Value, Exact Information, Uncertain Information, Table Cells, Temporal Uncertainty, Uncertain Data, Representation Of Uncertainty, Implicit Representation, Spatial Uncertainty, Point Symbol, Visual Clutter, Color Hue, Graphical Elements, Uncertain Value"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, PCS","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11575","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"cga1","slot_id":"v-cga-10198358","time_end":"2024-10-16T17:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T16:48:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T16:48:00Z","title":"Visualizing Uncertainty in Sets","uid":"v-cga-10198358","youtube_ff_id":"nFYQtRmiwzM","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/nFYQtRmiwzM","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-4EH4hLDfyA?start=2938"},{"abstract":"We report a study investigating the viability of using interactive visualizations to aid architectural design with building codes. While visualizations have been used to support general architectural design exploration, existing computational solutions treat building codes as separate from, rather than part of, the design process, creating challenges for architects. Through a series of participatory design studies with professional architects, we found that interactive visualizations have promising potential to aid design exploration and sensemaking in early stages of architectural design by providing feedback about potential allowances and consequences of design decisions. However, implementing a visualization system necessitates addressing the complexity and ambiguity inherent in building codes. To tackle these challenges, we propose various user-driven knowledge management mechanisms for integrating, negotiating, interpreting, and documenting building code rules.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"snowak@sfu.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Stan Nowak"},{"affiliations":"","email":"bon.aseniero@autodesk.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bon Adriel Aseniero"},{"affiliations":"","email":"lyn@sfu.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lyn Bartram"},{"affiliations":"","email":"tovi@dgp.toronto.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tovi Grossman"},{"affiliations":"","email":"George.fitzmaurice@autodesk.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"George Fitzmaurice"},{"affiliations":"","email":"justin.matejka@autodesk.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Justin Matejka"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-cga/v-cga-10227838/v-cga-10227838_Preview.mp4?token=kj-oA3y_pasQYoWCZtyXzfvynLKMBJFDKneU9PbgfLk&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-cga/v-cga-10227838/v-cga-10227838_Preview.srt?token=LMmZ-ChkH0tezmvWvNWVuorm1os61SHGICy2iBqjtp8&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Stan Nowak"],"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2023.3307971","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10227838","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Design probes exploring information visualization and broader interactive systems solutions to help architects design with building codes.","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"cga1","slot_id":"v-cga-10227838","time_end":"2024-10-16T17:12:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T17:00:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T17:00:00Z","title":"Identifying Visualization Opportunities to Help Architects Manage the Complexity of Building Codes","uid":"v-cga-10227838","youtube_ff_id":"uquxa5bjs8I","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/uquxa5bjs8I","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-4EH4hLDfyA?start=3721"},{"abstract":"The number of online news articles available nowadays is rapidly increasing.

A schedule is an assignment of the job operations to machines and times where and when they will be executed. The developers of computational methods for job scheduling need tools enabling them to explore how their methods work. At a high level of generality, we define the system of pertinent exploration tasks and a combination of visualizations capable of supporting the tasks. We provide general descriptions of the purposes, contents, visual encoding, properties, and interactive facilities of the visualizations and illustrate them with images from an example implementation in air traffic management.

However, uncertainty can also be represented via text or numerical information, and few studies have systematically compared these types of representations to visualizations of uncertainty. We present two experiments that compared visual representations of risk (icon arrays) to numerical representations (natural frequencies) in a wildfire evacuation task. Like prior studies, we found that different types of visual cues led to different patterns of decision making. In addition, our comparison of visual and numerical representations of risk found that people were more likely to evacuate when they saw visualizations than when they saw numerical representations.

Similarly, common workflows for exploratory visualization are built upon the idea of users interactively applying various filter and grouping mechanisms in search of new insights. This paradigm has proven effective at helping users identify correlations between variables that can inform thinking and decision-making. However, recent studies show that consumers of visualizations often draw causal conclusions even when not supported by the data. Motivated by these observations, this article highlights recent advances from a growing community of researchers exploring methods that aim to directly support visual causal inference. However, many of these approaches have their own limitations, which limit their use in many real-world scenarios. This article, therefore, also outlines a set of key open challenges and corresponding priorities for new research to advance the state of the art in visual causal inference.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"borland@renci.org","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Borland"},{"affiliations":"","email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"gotz@unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Gotz"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-cga/v-cga-10414267/v-cga-10414267_Preview.mp4?token=FVxCuB6xLp1DUV6Sm1Gh4cxqFbnyw2q5gHteaBAiyUw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-cga/v-cga-10414267/v-cga-10414267_Preview.srt?token=CY0_DiPO-Mt3EyALCu_X6qEaEG2xb9-IPY8DehrAEN0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Arran Zeyu Wan"],"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2023.3338788","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10414267","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"A counterfactual subset includes data points from the excluded set that closely resemble those in the included set.

How do drugs influence these processes? These are difficult questions that we can attempt to answer with a combination of time-series microscopy experiments, classification algorithms, and data visualization.However, collecting this type of data and applying algorithms to segment and track cells and construct lineages of proliferation is error-prone; and identifying the errors can be challenging since it often requires cross-checking multiple data types. Similarly, analyzing and communicating the results necessitates synthesizing different data types into a single narrative. State-of-the-art visualization methods for such data use independent line charts, tree diagrams, and images in separate views. However, this spatial separation requires the viewer of these charts to combine the relevant pieces of data in memory. To simplify this challenging task, we describe design principles for weaving cell images, time-series data, and tree data into a cohesive visualization. Our design principles are based on choosing a primary data type that drives the layout and integrates the other data types into that layout. We then introduce Aardvark, a system that uses these principles to implement novel visualization techniques. Based on Aardvark, we demonstrate the utility of each of these approaches for discovery, communication, and data debugging in a series of case studies.

Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability.

However, three key challenges with existing visualizations make it difficult for clinicians to find information efficiently. First, the document embeddings used in these visualizations are generated statically by pretrained language models, which cannot adapt to the user's evolving interest. Second, existing document visualization techniques cannot effectively display how the documents are relevant to users\u2019 interest, making it difficult for users to identify the most pertinent information. Third, existing embedding generation and visualization processes suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to understand, trust and use the result for decision-making. In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics pipeline for user-driven document representation and iterative information seeking (VADIS). VADIS introduces a prompt-based attention model (PAM) that generates dynamic document embedding and document relevance adjusted to the user's query. To effectively visualize these two pieces of information, we design a new document map that leverages a circular grid layout to display documents based on both their relevance to the query and the semantic similarity. Additionally, to improve the interpretability, we introduce a corpus-level attention visualization method to improve the user's understanding of the model focus and to enable the users to identify potential oversight. This visualization, in turn, empowers users to refine, update and introduce new queries, thereby facilitating a dynamic and iterative information-seeking experience. We evaluated VADIS quantitatively and qualitatively on a real-world dataset of biomedical research papers to demonstrate its effectiveness.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"qiu.580@buckeyemail.osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Rui Qiu"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"tu.253@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yamei Tu"},{"affiliations":["Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, United States"],"email":"yenp@wustl.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Po-Yin Yen"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States"],"email":"hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1802/v-full-1802_Preview.mp4?token=LA7YlgNQGkiZLyHEnN17Ob983PPFPSfpWFr16hnzl8M&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1802/v-full-1802_Preview.srt?token=_kmNMLgzJ1-tuMdPqbZvT77tnne1hHmQvmqvnSs1RrA&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Rui Qiu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Traditional document maps cluster documents based on static embeddings, leading to confusing grouping with inconsistent semantic concepts.

To scout suitable players, coaches and analysts need to consider whether the players will perform well in a new team, which is hard to learn directly from their historical performances. Match simulation methods have been introduced to scout players by estimating their expected contributions to a new team. However, they usually focus on the simulation of match results and hardly support interactive analysis to navigate potential target players and compare them in fine-grained simulated behaviors. In this work, we propose a visual analytics method to assist soccer player scouting based on match simulation. We construct a two-level match simulation framework for estimating both match results and player behaviors when a player comes to a new team. Based on the framework, we develop a visual analytics system, Team-Scouter, to facilitate the simulative-based soccer player scouting process through player navigation, comparison, and investigation. With our system, coaches and analysts can find potential players suitable for the team and compare them on historical and expected performances. For an in-depth investigation of the players' expected performances, the system provides a visual comparison between the simulated behaviors of the player and the actual ones. The usefulness and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world dataset and an expert interview.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"caoanqi28@163.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anqi Cao"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"xxie@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiao Xie"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"2366385033@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Runjin Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"1282533692@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuxin Tian"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"fanmu_032@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mu Fan"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"zhang_hui@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1031/v-full-1031_Preview.mp4?token=lZJeB6Xf0ge_YdGbBTun3RHwlGjYyPFmJbqOYHb7olQ&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1031/v-full-1031_Preview.srt?token=ioob5IkjvKKKvgqxCtdJinqPHLJNypauW9vO7Yg4uxw&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Anqi Cao"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"System user interface.

Both sports fans and experts have a demand for analyzing sports tactics. Existing approaches allow users to visually perceive the multivariate tactical effects. However, these approaches require users to experience a complex reasoning process to connect the multiple interactions within each tactic to the final tactical effect. In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs. Based on the framework, we design and develop Smartboard, an agent-based interactive visualization system for fine-grained tactical analysis, especially for play design. Smartboard provides users with a structured process of setup, simulation, and evolution, allowing for iterative exploration of tactics based on specific personalized scenarios.

Basketball tactics, involving a complex series of actions, require substantial knowledge to be fully understood. This complexity leads to a need for additional information and explanation, which can distract fans from the game. To tackle these challenges, we present Sportify, a Visual Question Answering system that integrates narratives and embedded visualization for demystifying basketball tactical questions, aiding fans in understanding various game aspects. We propose three novel action visualizations (i.e., Pass, Cut, and Screen) to demonstrate critical action sequences. To explain the reasoning and logic behind players\u2019 actions, we leverage a large-language model (LLM) to generate narratives. We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations. We evaluated Sportify with basketball fans to investigate its impact on understanding of tactics, and how different personal perspectives of narratives impact the understanding of complex tactic with action visualizations. Our evaluation with basketball fans demonstrates Sportify\u2019s capability to deepen tactical insights and amplify the viewing experience. Furthermore, third-person narration assists people in getting in-depth game explanations while first-person narration enhances fans\u2019 game engagement.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Harvard University, Allston, United States"],"email":"chungyi347@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Chunggi Lee"},{"affiliations":["Harvard University, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"mlin@g.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tica Lin"},{"affiliations":["Harvard University, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"pfister@seas.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanspeter Pfister"},{"affiliations":["University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Minneapolis, United States"],"email":"ztchen@umn.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chen Zhu-Tian"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1351/v-full-1351_Preview.mp4?token=bIGHDjLkrgJQpolXS_FEYprMGOPhEwvYQLjlBgRYK6Y&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1351/v-full-1351_Preview.srt?token=L7wsQyu7e4q3byPVBl_dcO_CathD-9_Gwi7yGt8AKvk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Chunggi Lee"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Sportify explains tactic questions in each clip for everyone, aiming to engage users and foster a love for sports.

The behavior of patrols in these situations can be modeled by patrolling games. They simulate the behavior of the patrol and adversary in the building, which is modeled as a graph of interconnected nodes representing rooms. The designers of algorithms solving the game face the problem of analyzing complex graph layouts with temporal dependencies. Therefore, appropriate visual support is crucial for them to work effectively. In this paper, we present a novel tool that helps the designers of patrolling games explore the outcomes of the proposed algorithms and approaches, evaluate their success rate, and propose modifications that can improve their solutions. Our tool offers an intuitive and interactive interface, featuring a detailed exploration of patrol routes and probabilities of taking them, simulation of patrols, and other requested features. In close collaboration with experts in designing patrolling games, we conducted three case studies demonstrating the usage and usefulness of our tool.

With their investment knowledge and professional skills, fund managers gain a competitive advantage over the average investor in the market. Consequently, investors prefer entrusting their investments to fund managers rather than directly investing in funds. For these investors, the primary concern is selecting a suitable fund manager. While previous studies have employed quantitative or qualitative methods to analyze various aspects of fund managers, such as performance metrics, personal characteristics, and performance persistence, they often face challenges when dealing with a large candidate space. Moreover, distinguishing whether a fund manager's performance stems from skill or luck poses a challenge, making it difficult to align with investors' preferences in the selection process. To address these challenges, this study characterizes the requirements of investors in selecting suitable fund managers and proposes an interactive visual analytics system called FMLens. This system streamlines the fund manager selection process, allowing investors to efficiently assess and deconstruct fund managers' investment styles and abilities across multiple dimensions. Additionally, the system empowers investors to scrutinize and compare fund managers' performances. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through two case studies and a qualitative user study. Feedback from domain experts indicates that the system excels in analyzing fund managers from diverse perspectives, enhancing the efficiency of fund manager evaluation and selection.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Longfei Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chen Cheng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"He Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiyuan Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yun Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuanwu Yue"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wong Kam-Kwai"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haipeng Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Suting Hong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quan Li"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243394745/v-tvcg-20243394745_Preview.mp4?token=S_DhSMZGe1pa7MrGSlMaB6fb6AOeVwyJ8Vq6x2taTpw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243394745/v-tvcg-20243394745_Preview.srt?token=5bL8lQRkexpMVVbZFfcuYdKEFLNpR__BUaDOBP2BXqY&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Longfei Chen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3394745","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"FMLens consists of four views: (A) The FM Overview serves as a summary of the fund manager candidate space.

Machine learning methods for impact dynamics analysis are incomprehensible and rigid in terms of their interpretability and transparency, whilst stakeholders require interactive tools for informed decision-making. Nevertheless, developing such a tool is challenging due to the substantial, heterogeneous NFT transaction data and the requirements for flexible, customized interactions. To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects. We first conduct a formative study and summarize analysis criteria, including substitution mechanisms, impact attributes, and design requirements from stakeholders. Next, we propose the Minimal Substitution Model to simulate substitutive systems of NFT projects that can be feasibly represented as node-link graphs. Particularly, we utilize attribute-aware techniques to embed the project status and stakeholder behaviors in the layout design. Accordingly, we develop a multi-view visual analytics system, namely NFTracer, allowing interactive analysis of impact dynamics in NFT transactions. We demonstrate the informativeness, effectiveness, and usability of NFTracer by performing two case studies with domain experts and one user study with stakeholders. The studies suggest that NFT projects featuring a higher degree of similarity are more likely to substitute each other. The impact of NFT projects within substitutive systems is contingent upon the degree of stakeholders\u2019 influx and projects\u2019 freshness.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yifan Cao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qing Shi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lucas Shen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kani Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wei Zeng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243402834/v-tvcg-20243402834_Preview.mp4?token=p2neHggXdErinSRXo2Xkd7ZOVpBAATdOPM_U9-LNycc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243402834/v-tvcg-20243402834_Preview.srt?token=DfO05-24gws9c8vL_kEeZJVzz3xWDOx0Nz9TyRq-lug&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yifan Cao"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3402834","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"**Figure 1:** Understanding the evolving appeal of NFT projects requires analyzing impact dynamics.

We investigate these issues within the domain of color palette design, which serves as a microcosm of visualization design concerns. We contribute a GUI-based color palette linter as a design probe that covers perception, accessibility, context, and other design criteria, and use it to explore visual explanations, integrated fixes, and user defined linting rules. Through a formative interview study and theory-driven analysis, we find that linters can be meaningfully integrated into graphical contextsthereby addressing many of their core issues.We discuss implications for integrating linters into visualization tools, developing improved assertion languages, and supporting end-user tunable advice---all laying the groundwork for more effective visualization linters in any context.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States","University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"mcnutt.andrew@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Andrew M McNutt"},{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"maureen.stone@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Maureen Stone"},{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"jheer@uw.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1290/v-full-1290_Preview.mp4?token=NkJBbD0Gt1xNNy93YGu-u2bvj6CkT8d0wcJdXjEMsHY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1290/v-full-1290_Preview.srt?token=mgzxzUfCmwcweO_V8-7UDRSbREJDumR1vwvE7SA5do0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Andrew M McNutt"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"How do you know when what you\u2019ve done is right?

However, as the number of classes increases, it is challenging to generate a high-quality color assignment result that accommodates all classes simultaneously. A practical solution is to organize classes into a hierarchy and then dynamically assign colors during exploration. However, existing color assignment methods fall short in generating high-quality color assignment results and dynamically aligning them with hierarchical structures. To address this issue, we develop a dynamic color assignment method for hierarchical data, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. This method simultaneously considers color discriminability, color harmony, and spatial distribution at each hierarchical level. By using the colors of parent classes to guide the color assignment of their child classes, our method further promotes both consistency and clarity across hierarchical levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating dynamic color assignment results with quantitative experiments and a user study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"jiashu0717c@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiashu Chen"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"vicayang496@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"jiazl22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zelin Jia"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"tarolancy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lanxi Xiao"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"shixia@tsinghua.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1595/v-full-1595_Preview.mp4?token=toj6GxPoOhr1jLn6j9nD71SzjSzQTxHw6k3YcrcXjAo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1595/v-full-1595_Preview.srt?token=jIle7eUQz-qE5I07DktS3QVaM3zuo11YTABZfXIlcjc&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Weikai Yang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Based on user exploration, our method dynamically selects the color range and assigns colors to classes within the range, which ensures high discriminability and harmony at each level and maintains consistency across different levels.","keywords":["Color assignment, Hierarchical Visualization, Discriminability, Harmony."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/e4b5u/?view_only=68cc67c194c443b498bd2545ef551faa","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, both PCS and external","paper_award":"honorable","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14742","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full10","slot_id":"v-full-1595","time_end":"2024-10-16T18:21:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T18:09:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T18:09:00Z","title":"Dynamic Color Assignment for Hierarchical Data","uid":"v-full-1595","youtube_ff_id":"RjtAd4XmMsU","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/RjtAd4XmMsU","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yBF6qqK_ASs?start=1499"},{"abstract":"Shape is commonly used to distinguish between categories in multi-class scatterplots. However, existing guidelines for choosing effective shape palettes rely largely on intuition and do not consider how these needs may change as the number of categories increases. Unlike color, shapes can not be represented by a numerical space, making it difficult to propose general guidelines or design heuristics for using shape effectively. This paper presents a series of four experiments evaluating the efficiency of 39 shapes across three tasks: relative mean judgment tasks, expert preference, and correlation estimation. Our results show that conventional means for reasoning about shapes, such as filled versus unfilled, are insufficient to inform effective palette design. Further, even expert palettes vary significantly in their use of shape and corresponding effectiveness. To support effective shape palette design, we developed a model based on pairwise relations between shapes in our experiments and the number of shapes required for a given design. We embed this model in a palette design tool to give designers agency over shape selection while incorporating empirical elements of perceptual performance captured in our study. Our model advances understanding of shape perception in visualization contexts and provides practical design guidelines that can help improve categorical data encodings.

In this study, we investigated whether value-to-area legends (square symbols next to the values represented by the squares' areas) and grid lines aid map readers in making better area judgments. We conducted an experiment to determine the accuracy, speed, and confidence with which readers infer numerical data values for the mapped regions. We found that, when only informed about the total numerical value represented by the whole cartogram without any legend, the distribution of estimates for individual regions was centered near the true value with substantial spread. Legends with grid lines significantly reduced the spread but led to a tendency to underestimate the values. Comparing differences between regions or between cartograms revealed that legends and grid lines slowed the estimation without improving accuracy. However, participants were more likely to complete the tasks when legends and grid lines were present, particularly when the area units represented by these features could be interactively selected. We recommend considering the cartogram's use case and purpose before deciding whether to include grid lines or an interactive legend.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kelvin L.

Each sentence is a comparison: the mean of these is higher than those; this difference is smaller than that. What determines which comparisons are made first? The viewer's goals and expertise matter, but the way that values are visually grouped together within the chart also impacts those comparisons. Research from psychology suggests that comparisons involve multiple steps. First, the viewer divides the visualization into a set of units. This might include a single bar or a grouped set of bars. Then the viewer selects and compares two of these units, perhaps noting that one pair of bars is longer than another. Viewers might take an additional third step and perform a second-order comparison, perhaps determining that the difference between one pair of bars is greater than the difference between another pair. We create a visual comparison taxonomy that allows us to develop and test a sequence of hypotheses about which comparisons people are more likely to make when reading a visualization. We find that people tend to compare two groups before comparing two individual bars and that second-order comparisons are rare. Visual cues like spatial proximity and color can influence which elements are grouped together and selected for comparison, with spatial proximity being a stronger grouping cue. Interestingly, once the viewer grouped together and compared a set of bars, regardless of whether the group is formed by spatial proximity or color similarity, they no longer consider other possible groupings in their comparisons.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andrew Lovett"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Steven Franconeri"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233289292/v-tvcg-20233289292_Preview.mp4?token=FioY-BPSr_2MbWrgkD2XLq8GLNsMALBaddZ05hvtkfI&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Cindy Xiong Bearfield"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3289292","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"When designing simple bar charts depicting the revenue of two companies A and B in two regions East and West, one can group the bars spatially by company such that West A and East A are closer together, and West B and East B are close together.

First, we distill qualitative and quantitative findings from our studies to characterize current practices of text use in dashboards, including a categorization of text-based components and design patterns. Second, we leverage current practices and existing literature to propose, discuss, and validate recommended practices for text in dashboards, embodied as a set of 12 heuristics that underscore the semantic and functional role of text in offering navigational cues, contextualizing data insights, supporting reading order, among other concerns.

However, despite their widespread use, we identified a lack of a design space for common practices for annotations. In this paper, we evaluated over 1,800 static annotated charts to understand how people annotate visualizations in practice. Through qualitative coding of these diverse real-world annotated charts, we explored three primary aspects of annotation usage patterns: analytic purposes for chart annotations (e.g., present, identify, summarize, or compare data features), mechanisms for chart annotations (e.g., types and combinations of annotations used, frequency of different annotation types across chart types, etc.), and the data source used to generate the annotations.

Metaphors play an essential part in visual communication and are frequently employed to explain complex concepts. However, their use is often based on intuition, rather than following a formal process. At present, we lack tools and language for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g., infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains (biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science. This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex scientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory tool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on a spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual metaphors.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"email":"hana.pokojna@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hana Pokojn\u00e1"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Orsay, France","Inria, Saclay, France"],"email":"tobias.isenberg@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":["University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"email":"stefan.bruckner@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stefan Bruckner"},{"affiliations":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"email":"kozlikova@fi.muni.cz","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barbora Kozlikova"},{"affiliations":["University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"email":"laura.garrison@uib.no","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Laura Garrison"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1316/v-full-1316_Preview.mp4?token=aom1JV67M5JX6eNDgcArCWIG3btpoAxnO5PPvGZrCZI&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Hana Pokojn\u00e1"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"image_VisualMetaphors This image illustrates our process (from left to right) for identifying and classifying visual conceptual metaphors in scientific infographics: 1) deconstruct a given infographic to its component graphics, 2) identify component graphics as visual conceptual metaphors versus visual abstractions, 3) classify the conceptual metaphor type (structural, ontological, orientational, or imagistic), and 4) provide infographic metadata and classify the spatiotemporal scale of the phenomenon visualized to enable detailed investigation in our Visual Exploratory Tool.

Although research in this area has remained lively, we believe it is essential to continuously revisit this classic and critical topic in visualization research by incorporating more empirical evidence from diverse sources, characterizing new design flaws, building more systematic theoretical frameworks, and understanding the underlying reasons for these flaws. To address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws through the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and categorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur. Specifically, we analyzed 2227 flawed data visualizations collected from an online gallery and derived a design task-associated taxonomy containing 76 specific design flaws. These flaws were further classified into three high-level categories (i.e., misinformation, uninformativeness, unsociability) and ten subcategories (e.g., inaccuracy, unfairness, ambiguity). Next, we organized five focus groups to explore why these design flaws occur and identified seven causes of the flaws.

CataAnno searches for the most relevant examples previously annotated and recommends to the user. Meanwhile, the cross-linked views assist users in comprehending the correlations between entries and offer explanations for these recommendations. Evaluation and expert feedback confirm that the CataAnno system, by offering high-quality recommendations and visualizing the relationships between entries, can mitigate the necessity for specialized knowledge during the annotation process.

In this work, we ask how interactive visualization can benefit PB by conducting a design probe-based interview study (N=13) with policy workers and academics with expertise in PB, urban planning, and civic HCI. Our probe explores how graphical elicitation of voter preferences and a dashboard of voting statistics can be incorporated into a realistic PB tool. Through qualitative analysis, we find that visualization creates opportunities for city government to set expectations about budget constraints while also granting their constituents greater freedom to articulate a wider range of preferences. However, using visualization to provide transparency about PB requires efforts to mitigate potential access barriers and mistrust.

This journey yielded a rich set of original knowledge. We formalized a design space for two-party election forecasts, navigating through dimensions like data transformations, visual channels, and types of animated narratives. Through qualitative evaluation of ten representative prototypes with 13 participants, we then identi\ufb01ed six core insights into the interpretation of uncertainty visualizations in a U.S. election context. These insights informed our revisions to remove ambiguity in our visual encodings and to prepare a professional-looking forecasting website. As part of this story, we also distilled challenges faced and design lessons learned to inform both designers and practitioners. Ultimately, we hope our methodical approach could inspire others in the community to tackle the hard problems inherent to designing and evaluating visualizations for the general public.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"fumeng.p.yang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fumeng Yang"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States","Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"mandicai2028@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mandi Cai"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"chloemortenson2026@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chloe Rose Mortenson"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"hoda@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hoda Fakhari"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"aysedlokmanoglu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ayse Deniz Lokmanoglu"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"nicholas.diakopoulos@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicholas Diakopoulos"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"erik.nisbet@northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Erik Nisbet"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Chicago, United States"],"email":"matthew.kay@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthew Kay"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1488/v-full-1488_Preview.mp4?token=YEVn09ch56y13mFON0apbM7OHxXyXR0MIoh07wLauQs&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1488/v-full-1488_Preview.srt?token=EIKBFxA2WYMJZ5-WNVd7RX0F558nVKQtCGmnsQFM1Ic&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Fumeng Yang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We iterated over numerous designs for the election forecast visualizations for the 2022 governor elections.

From early infographics to recent data-driven storytelling, visualization has become an integrated part of contemporary journalism, primarily as a communication artifact to inform the general public. Data journalism, harnessing the power of data visualization, has emerged as a bridge between the growing volume of data and our society. Visualization research that centers around data storytelling has sought to understand and facilitate such journalistic endeavors. However, a recent metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and thus broaden visualization research's scope and practical contribution to this evolving field. We first survey recent significant shifts, emerging challenges, and computational practices in journalism. We then summarize six roles of computing in journalism and their implications. Based on these implications, we provide propositions for visualization research concerning each role. Ultimately, by mapping the roles and propositions onto a proposed ecological model and contextualizing existing visualization research, we surface seven general topics and a series of research agendas that can guide future visualization research at this intersection.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yu Fu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"John Stasko"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233287585/v-tvcg-20233287585_Preview.mp4?token=_kT4xh5FeUt7w5Nhf5xrZIZbU3GAPDjkCZH90GmLwcY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233287585/v-tvcg-20233287585_Preview.srt?token=L-kBpKwLlfShttlv4uMAZZRYshD-haWVX6NJnJKx1a8&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yu Fu"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3287585","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This diagram highlights the intersection of journalism and visualization, focusing on Six Roles of Computing in Journalism: Facilitator, Analyzer, Communicator, Public Forum, Automator, and Auditor.

Recent research on the persuasive appeal of data visualizations suggests that prior attitudes can be notoriously difficult to change. Inspired by an NYT article, we designed two experiments to evaluate the impact of elicitation and contrasting narratives on attitude change, recall, and engagement. We hypothesized that eliciting prior beliefs leads to more elaborative thinking that ultimately results in higher attitude change, better recall, and engagement. Our findings revealed that visual elicitation leads to higher engagement in terms of feelings of surprise. While there is an overall attitude change across all experiment conditions, we did not observe a significant effect of belief elicitation on attitude change. With regard to recall error, while participants in the draw trend elicitation exhibited significantly lower recall error than participants in the categorize trend condition, we found no significant difference in recall error when comparing elicitation conditions to no elicitation. In a follow-up study, we added contrasting narratives with the purpose of making the main visualization (communicating data on the focal issue) appear strikingly different. Compared to the results of Study 1, we found that contrasting narratives improved engagement in terms of surprise and interest but interestingly resulted in higher recall error and no significant change in attitude. We discuss the effects of elicitation and contrasting narratives in the context of topic involvement and the strengths of temporal trends encoded in the data visualization.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Milad Rogha"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Subham Sah"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alireza Karduni"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Douglas Markant"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wenwen Dou"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243355884/v-tvcg-20243355884_Preview.mp4?token=nw4kl_fRHfxOfS0H7UuBVjdlxGqlCmM-pK__biskZ4I&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243355884/v-tvcg-20243355884_Preview.srt?token=JEfeNpbl8wrsDFdI5umzIeceGgHcse6UJpJmkBCfq0A&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Milad Rogha"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3355884","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Data visualizations in news articles not only inform but also play a crucial role in shaping public opinion on important issues.

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jykim@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jaeyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"sihyeon@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sihyeon Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliations":["Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"gooday19@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Keon-Joo Lee"},{"affiliations":["Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin-si, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"bkim@hufs.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bohyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"braindoc@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"HEE JOON"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1121/v-full-1121_Preview.mp4?token=lSkRirWnWHhBzgGO2eXgj7s4VeGJqJXdwF--jEY_GC8&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1121/v-full-1121_Preview.srt?token=hwvYBVFbHn0wLpZURC3KYGxqDt__oD8g1j19mCZQKZk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Jaeyoung Kim"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"PhenoFlow empowers neurologists to explore large and complex stroke datasets with reduced cognitive load.

However, prompt evaluation, especially at the dataset scale, remains complex due to the need to assess prompts across thousands of test instances within a dataset. Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation. In the context of text summarization, our workflow advocates evaluation with summary characteristics (feature metrics) such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements for text summarization through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the xeffectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation of summarization prompts, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks. For future works, we advocate moving towards feature-oriented evaluation of LLM prompts and discuss unsolved challenges in terms of human-agent interaction.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of California Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"ytlee@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"abahukhandi@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aryaman Bahukhandi"},{"affiliations":["University of California at Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"dyuliu@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dongyu Liu"},{"affiliations":["University of California at Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1474/v-full-1474_Preview.mp4?token=8Hfco-UGUujuyZG-6mVef9LTBGpU15pw5Etlf-Jd148&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1474/v-full-1474_Preview.srt?token=BJaRDhTR-831s4wGTxWJtiiJw0QfZMYQkc2ymh0z7nY&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Sam Yu-Te Lee"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Bubble Plot, the key visualization in Awesum, designed to show prompt performance.

However, prioritizing expressiveness often impedes the learnability of the authoring interface. The diversity of users, such as varying computational skills and prior experiences in user interfaces, makes it even more challenging for a single authoring interface to satisfy the needs of a broad audience. In this paper, we introduce a framework to balance learnability and expressivity in a visualization authoring system. Adopting insights from learnability studies, such as multimodal interaction and visualization literacy, we explore the design space of blending multiple visualization authoring interfaces for supporting authoring tasks in a complementary and flexible manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of blending interfaces, we implemented a proof-of-concept system, Blace, that combines four common visualization authoring interfaces\u2014template-based, shelf configuration, natural language, and code editor\u2014that are tightly linked to one another to help users easily relate unfamiliar interfaces to more familiar ones. Using the system, we conducted a user study with 12 domain experts who regularly visualize genomics data as part of their analysis workflow. Participants with varied visualization and programming backgrounds were able to successfully reproduce unfamiliar visualization examples without a guided tutorial in the study. Feedback from a post-study qualitative questionnaire further suggests that blending interfaces enabled participants to learn the system easily and assisted them in confidently editing unfamiliar visualization grammar in the code editor, enabling expressive customization. Reflecting on our study results and the design of our system, we discuss the different interaction patterns that we identified and design implications for blending visualization authoring interfaces.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"sehi_lyi@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sehi L'Yi"},{"affiliations":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"email":"a.v.d.brandt@tue.nl","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Astrid van den Brandt"},{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"etowah_adams@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Etowah Adams"},{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"huyen_nguyen@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huyen N.

However, due to the richness of data types, visual designs, and interaction designs, users need to recall and process a significant amount of information when they visually analyze data. These challenges emphasize the need for more intelligent visual analytics methods. Large language models have demonstrated the ability to interpret various forms of textual data, offering the potential to facilitate intelligent support for visual analytics. We propose LEVA, a framework that uses large language models to enhance users' VA workflows at multiple stages: onboarding, exploration, and summarization. To support onboarding, we use large language models to interpret visualization designs and view relationships based on system specifications. For exploration, we use large language models to recommend insights based on the analysis of system status and data to facilitate mixed-initiative exploration. For summarization, we present a selective reporting strategy to retrace analysis history through a stream visualization and generate insight reports with the help of large language models.

One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users' natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuan Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Weiwei Cui"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dazhen Deng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xinjing Yi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yurun Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haidong Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243368621/v-tvcg-20243368621_Preview.mp4?token=NNF1tI9DBJHzeUfhANxgTkE_e5Wdnhf03qWc96g5uIc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243368621/v-tvcg-20243368621_Preview.srt?token=JSh5JMzUk880YDcFVfesTjDI-6QZABZFEW1cy5mL7Ps&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yuan Tian"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3368621","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"ChartGPT overview.

However, most users have a limited understanding of how such models work and often rely on trial and error strategies to achieve satisfactory results. The prompt history contains a wealth of information that could provide users with insights into what has been explored and how the prompt changes impact the output image, yet little research attention has been paid to the visual analysis of such process to support users. We propose the Image Variant Graph, a novel visual representation designed to support comparing prompt-image pairs and exploring the editing history. The Image Variant Graph models prompt differences as edges between corresponding images and presents the distances between images through projection. Based on the graph, we developed the PrompTHis system through co-design with artists. Based on the review and analysis of the prompting history, users can better understand the impact of prompt changes and have a more effective control of image generation. A quantitative user study and qualitative interviews demonstrate that PrompTHis can help users review the prompt history, make sense of the model, and plan their creative process.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuhan Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanning Shao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Can Liu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kai Xu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiaoru Yuan"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243408255/v-tvcg-20243408255_Preview.mp4?token=keSV0ZsZjbxswmhd2djgTyYh3KPJ_LcbgLW7qmu0kRA&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243408255/v-tvcg-20243408255_Preview.srt?token=H_KJT2BEr0QXj2brQhZcW1C4mJEGqg1WlEgPGKBSH40&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yuhan Guo"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3408255","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"When using text-to-image generative models, users might spend a lot of time in trials and errors.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks.

This paper introduces KnowNet, a visualization system that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KG) to provide enhanced accuracy and structured exploration. One core idea in KnowNet is to conceptualize the understanding of a subject as the gradual construction of graph visualization, aligning the user's cognitive process with both the structured data in KGs and the unstructured outputs from LLMs. Specifically, we extracted triples (e.g., entities and their relations) from LLM outputs and mapped them into the validated information and supported evidence in external KGs.

Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as spatial layouts. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs exhibit such sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggled to generate semantically diverse and factually accurate takeaways. In Experiment 2, we used the optimal configurations to generate 30 chart takeaways each for eight visualizations across four layouts and two datasets in both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to human takeaways, we found that the takeaways LLMs generated often did not match the types of comparisons made by humans. In Experiment 3, we examined the effect of chart context and data on LLM takeaways. We found that LLMs, unlike humans, exhibited variation in takeaway comparison types for different bar charts using the same bar layout. Overall, our case study evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human chart takeaways.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Huichen Will Wang"},{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, Seattle, United States"],"email":"jhoffs@adobe.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jane Hoffswell"},{"affiliations":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, United States"],"email":"yukithane@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sao Myat Thazin Thane"},{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, San Jose, United States"],"email":"victorbursztyn2022@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor S.

In structural biology, this process is necessary to semi-automatically composite large mesoscale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. The current approaches require manual fitting in three dimensions to start, resulting in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. The DiffFit approach enables domain scientists to fit new structures automatically and visualize the results for inspection and interactive revision. The fitting begins with differentiable three-dimensional (3D) rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates followed by sampling the density values at the atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we proposed a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. This loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring the fitting accuracy and an improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found it to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases: automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes and facilitating the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in identifying unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFitViewer) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

Each phase is supported by a specific set of abstracted 2D visual representations of proteins and their loops that are interactively linked with the 3D View of proteins. By sequentially passing through the individual phases, the user shapes the list of loops that are potential candidates for loop grafting. Finally, the actual in-silico insertion of the loop candidates from one protein to the other is performed, and the results are visually presented to the user. In this way, the fully computational rational design of proteins and their loops results in newly designed protein structures that can be further assembled and tested through in-vitro experiments.

By analyzing cellular interactions, biomedical experts can gain a more accurate understanding of the intricate relationships between cancer and immune cells. Recent methods have focused on inferring interaction based on the proximity of cells in low-resolution 2D multi-channel imaging data. By contrast, we analyze cell interactions by quantifying the presence and levels of specific proteins within a tissue sample (protein expressions) extracted from high-resolution 3D multi-channel volume data. Such analyses have a strong exploratory nature and require a tight integration of domain experts in the analysis loop to leverage their deep knowledge. We propose two complementary semi-automated approaches to cope with the increasing size and complexity of the data interactively: On the one hand, we interpret cell-to-cell interactions as edges in a cell graph and analyze the image signal (protein expressions) along those edges, using spatial as well as abstract visualizations. Complementary, we propose a cell-centered approach, enabling scientists to visually analyze polarized distributions of proteins in three dimensions, which also captures neighboring cells with biochemical and cell biological consequences. We evaluate our application in three case studies, where biologists and medical experts use \\tool to investigate tumor micro-environments to identify and quantify T-cell activation in human tissue data.

Such a development comes at the cost of increased demands on throughput in genomic data analysis.

CNV calls are generated algorithmically, but time-consuming manual intervention is needed to separate relevant findings from irrelevant ones in the resulting large call candidate lists. We present a visualization environment, named Copycat, to support this review task in a clinical scenario.Key components are a scatter-glyph plot replacing the traditional list visualization, and a glyph representation designed for at-a-glance relevance assessments.

Our method is tailored for scenes, which are procedurally constructed, based on a given set of building rules. Rendering of large scenes normally requires the entire scene available in-core, or alternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory hierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory management, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly. The key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction strategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is available in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is populated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire scene. Most of the grid cells are not filled with geometry, only those are populated that are potentially seen by the camera. The atomistic detail is populated in a compute shader and its representation is connected with acceleration data structures for hardware ray-tracing of modern GPUs. Objects which are far away, where atomistic detail is not perceivable from a given viewpoint, are represented by a triangle mesh mapped with a seamless texture, generated from the rendering of geometry from atomistic detail. The algorithm consists of two pipelines, the construction-compute pipeline, and the rendering pipeline, which work together to render molecular scenes at an atomistic resolution far beyond the limit of the GPU memory containing trillions of atoms. We demonstrate our technique on multiple models of SARS-CoV-2 and the red blood cell.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ruwayda Alharbi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ond\u02c7rej Strnad"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Klein"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ivan Viola"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243411786/v-tvcg-20243411786_Preview.mp4?token=Sfz1lUTn5a3NOZ0Ph_-sj5NUxB6j2ZFi0aFaci4A1-8&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243411786/v-tvcg-20243411786_Preview.srt?token=qaKnYH41-gSfCdIe9N907yzyt99YIX9TAQx23ahNJIo&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Ruwayda Alharbi"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3411786","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Several populated SARS-CoV-2 virions over Red blood cell particles.

In traditional screen-based visualisations, focus-and-context techniques allow visualisation users to keep a full dataset in view while making detailed selections. Such techniques have been studied extensively on desktop to allow precise selection within large data sets, but they have not been explored in immersive 3D modalities. In this paper we develop a novel immersive focus-and-context technique based on a ``magic portal'' metaphor adapted specifically for data visualisation scenarios. An extendable-hand interaction technique is used to place a portal close to the region of interest.The other end of the portal then opens comfortably within the user's physical reach such that they can reach through to precisely select individual data points.Through a controlled study with 12 participants, we find strong evidence that portals reduce overshoots in selection and overall hand trajectory length, reducing arm and shoulder fatigue compared to ranged interaction without the portal.The portals also enable us to use a robot arm to provide haptic feedback for data within the limited volume of the portal region. In a second study with another 12 participants we found that haptics provided a positive experience (qualitative feedback) but did not significantly reduce fatigue. We demonstrate applications for portal-based selection through two use-case scenarios.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"dai.shaozhang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shaozhang Dai"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"yi.li5@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yi Li"},{"affiliations":["The University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus), Kelowna, Canada"],"email":"barrett.ens@ubc.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barrett Ens"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"lonni.besancon@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lonni Besan\u00e7on"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"tgdwyer@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tim Dwyer"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1699/v-full-1699_Preview.mp4?token=wT8OvZyLiVvdKlORk7nzC3ZNKxJnACWjffJwJAYdzQU&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1699/v-full-1699_Preview.srt?token=qiiiLObmOmzdMBa6T5PyiZm9r3DRn9EQAmrxulLxlZs&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Lonni Besan\u00e7on"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Magic Portal for data selection.

However, integration operations are usually separate from visual analytics operations such as encode and filter in both interface design and empirical research. We conducted a preliminary user study to investigate whether and how data integration should be incorporated directly into the visual analytics process. We used two interface alternatives featuring contrasting approaches to the data preparation and analysis workflow: manual file-based ex-situ integration as a separate step from visual analytics operations; and automatic UI-based in-situ integration merged with visual analytics operations. Participants were asked to complete specific and free-form tasks with each interface, browsing for patterns, generating insights, and summarizing relationships between attributes distributed across multiple files. Analyzing participants' interactions and feedback, we found both task completion time and total interactions to be similar across interfaces and tasks, as well as unique integration strategies between interfaces and emergent behaviors related to satisficing and cognitive bias. Participants' time spent and interactions revealed that in-situ integration enabled users to spend more time on analysis tasks compared with ex-situ integration. Participants' integration strategies and analytical behaviors revealed differences in interface usage for generating and tracking hypotheses and insights. With these results, we synthesized preliminary guidelines for designing future visual analytics interfaces that can support integrating attributes throughout an active analysis process.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adam Coscia"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ashley Suh"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alex Endert"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233334513/v-tvcg-20233334513_Preview.mp4?token=Hl9uNjL8zDZnP5-6I9K85S2LiboQcD3u9kavKSJC9JY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233334513/v-tvcg-20233334513_Preview.srt?token=X4-7kksvv3BwCLt9AwOuiXQ1n9hNxJx4AI3eTJky3Mg&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Adam Coscia"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3334513","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"We studied differences in sensemaking during visual data analysis between manually integrating data with Excel versus automatic integration built-in to a visual analytics interface.

The potential of augmented reality (AR) to integrate digital information into the physical world provides new opportunities for visualizing and interpreting scientific data. However, a limitation of OST-HMD technology is that rendered pixels of a virtual object can interfere with the colors of the real-world, making it challenging to perceive the augmented virtual information accurately. We address this challenge in a two-step approach. First, VoxAR determines an appropriate placement of the volume-rendered object in the real-world scene by evaluating a set of spatial and environmental objectives, managed as user-selected preferences and pre-defined constraints. We achieve a real-time solution by implementing the objectives using a GPU shader language.Next, VoxAR adjusts the colors of the input transfer function (TF) based on the real-world placement region. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization method that adjusts the TF colors such that the resulting volume-rendered pixels are discernible against the background and the TF maintains the perceptual mapping between the colors and data intensity values. Finally, we present an assessment of our approach through objective evaluations and subjective user studies.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Saeed Boorboor"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthew S.

This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"ktang2@nd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1391/v-full-1391_Preview.mp4?token=ITGmgaQ31HqudY__3ys3icjyOy8ieyvto0Z2lDmm_8A&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Kaiyuan Tang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"StyleRF-VolVis is an innovative style transfer framework based on the neural radiance field for expressive volume visualization.

Second, by directly dragging structure-related features in the visualizations, users can intuitively understand the controlling effect of different parameters. Third, with the understanding from the earlier step, users can steer ParamsDrag to produce dynamic visual outcomes.

As SRNs are black-box lossy data representations, assessing the prediction quality is critical for scientific visualization applications to ensure that scientists can trust the information being visualized. Currently, existing architectures do not support inference time reconstruction quality assessment, as coordinate-level errors cannot be evaluated in the absence of ground truth data. By employing the uncertain neural network architecture in feature grid SRNs, we obtain prediction variances during inference time to facilitate confidence-aware data reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-decoder SRN (MDSRN) architecture consisting of a shared feature grid with multiple lightweight multi-layer perceptron decoders. MDSRN can generate a set of plausible predictions for a given input coordinate to compute the mean as the prediction of the multi-decoder ensemble and the variance as a confidence score. The coordinate-level variance can be rendered along with the data to inform the reconstruction quality, or be integrated into uncertainty-aware volume visualization algorithms. To prevent the misalignment between the quantified variance and the prediction quality, we propose a novel variance regularization loss for ensemble learning that promotes the Regularized multi-decoder SRN (RMDSRN) to obtain a more reliable variance that correlates closely to the true model error. We comprehensively evaluate the quality of variance quantification and data reconstruction of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Mean Field Variational Inference (MFVI), Deep Ensemble (DE), and Predicting Variance (PV) in comparison with our proposed MDSRN and RMDSRN applied to state-of-the-art feature grid SRNs across diverse scalar field datasets. We demonstrate that RMDSRN attains the most accurate data reconstruction and competitive variance-error correlation among uncertain SRNs under the same neural network parameter budgets. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of uncertainty-aware volume rendering and shed light on the potential of incorporating uncertain predictions in improving the quality of volume rendering for uncertain SRNs. Through ablation studies on the regularization strength and decoder count, we show that MDSRN and RMDSRN are expected to perform sufficiently well with a default configuration without requiring customized hyperparameter settings for different datasets.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"xiong.336@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tianyu Xiong"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"wurster.18@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Skylar Wolfgang Wurster"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States","Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tom Peterka"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States"],"email":"hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1866/v-full-1866_Preview.mp4?token=JvYFoDniHtLPq0JNoRUiG6oNdGm3_ZCRaIqpCOhs9yY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1866/v-full-1866_Preview.srt?token=7-modfywyiOsocXo-RX1xgkeCSva1HmuLauuXK2XFW0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Tianyu Xiong"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"By training multiple lightweight decoders and combining a variance regularization in the loss function, regularized multi-decoder SRN (RMDSRN) enables any feature grid SRN to produce uncertain predictions, such that a variance can be computed and visualized for post-training prediction quality assessment.

The approach consists of two stages: spatial compression and model aggregation. In the first stage, each time step is compressed using an implicit neural representation with bottleneck layers and features of interest preservation-based sampling. In the second stage, we utilize an offline knowledge distillation algorithm to extract knowledge from the trained models and aggregate it into a single model. We evaluated our approach on a variety of time-varying volumetric data sets. Both quantitative and qualitative results, such as PSNR, LPIPS, and rendered images, demonstrate that KD-INR surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches, including learning-based (i.e., CoordNet, NeurComp, and SIREN) and lossy compression (i.e., SZ3, ZFP, and TTHRESH) methods, at various compression ratios ranging from hundreds to ten thousand.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jun Han"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hao Zheng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Change Bi"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233345373/v-tvcg-20233345373_Preview.mp4?token=G8qsRJ43TvtKl9ixMm-0EzulO0vYdyrc45e6mkBK4Kk&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233345373/v-tvcg-20233345373_Preview.srt?token=TxuFh0QqKDQp8HO0I4LFp4rEB6p1OeuIylrsWpoU994&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Han Jun"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3345373","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"We propose KD-INR, a knowledge distillation-based implicit neural representation, enabling to sequentially compress time-varying data with memory effciency.","keywords":["Time-varying data compression, implicit neural representation, knowledge distillation, volume visualization."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"No","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full17","slot_id":"v-tvcg-20233345373","time_end":"2024-10-16T12:42:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T12:30:00Z","title":"KD-INR: Time-Varying Volumetric Data Compression via Knowledge Distillation-based Implicit Neural Representation","uid":"v-tvcg-20233345373","youtube_ff_id":"wPUZtAngZUk","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/wPUZtAngZUk","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-VxwRlkinOQ?start=38"},{"abstract":"Implicit Neural representations (INRs) are widely used for scientific data reduction and visualization by modeling the function that maps a spatial location to a data value. Without any prior knowledge about the spatial distribution of values, we are forced to sample densely from INRs to perform visualization tasks like iso-surface extraction which can be very computationally expensive. Recently, range analysis has shown promising results in improving the efficiency of geometric queries, such as ray casting and hierarchical mesh extraction, on INRs for 3D geometries by using arithmetic rules to bound the output range of the network within a spatial region. However, the analysis bounds are often too conservative for complex scientific data. In this paper, we present an improved technique for range analysis by revisiting the arithmetic rules and analyzing the probability distribution of the network output within a spatial region. We model this distribution efficiently as a Gaussian distribution by applying the central limit theorem. Excluding low probability values, we are able to tighten the output bounds, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the value range, and hence more accurate identification of iso-surface cells and more efficient iso-surface extraction on INRs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of the iso-surface extraction time on four datasets compared to the original range analysis method and can also be generalized to other geometric query tasks.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Haoyu Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243365089/v-tvcg-20243365089_Preview.mp4?token=YSsQqjdhLKylaN5IeHQC47JZTglIl1_TAOSsSfKkdvc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243365089/v-tvcg-20243365089_Preview.srt?token=phWo3Qr_Bff0OgzJr7-XKTgDhv37s7bU3np7TbOOGmg&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Haoyu Li"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3365089","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This image shows the iso-surface extraction results comparison between our approach on the right and the traditional approach on the left.

Consequently, it is crucial to design effective visual representations for large graphs. In this paper, we propose AdaMotif, a novel approach that can capture the essential structure patterns of large graphs and effectively reveal the overall structures via adaptive motif designs. Specifically, our approach involves partitioning a given large graph into multiple subgraphs, then clustering similar subgraphs and extracting similar structural information within each cluster. Subsequently, adaptive motifs representing each cluster are generated and utilized to replace the corresponding subgraphs, leading to a simplified visualization. Our approach aims to preserve as much information as possible from the subgraphs while simplifying the graph efficiently. Notably, our approach successfully visualizes crucial community information within a large graph. We conduct case studies and a user study using real-world graphs to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate the capability of our approach in simplifying graphs while retaining important structural and community information.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"hzhou@szu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hong Zhou"},{"affiliations":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"laipeifeng1111@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Peifeng Lai"},{"affiliations":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"zhida.sun@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhida Sun"},{"affiliations":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"2310274034@email.szu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiangyuan Chen"},{"affiliations":["Shenzhen University, Shen Zhen, China"],"email":"275621136@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Chen"},{"affiliations":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"hswu@szu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huisi Wu"},{"affiliations":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yong WANG"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1606/v-full-1606_Preview.mp4?token=XNAI--kxzKJbfnEWfEQn-z-dQs-XeCUps7OttO-Ri_8&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1606/v-full-1606_Preview.srt?token=yyU1vwaX2Yxq1I7tJ61fvdARcrkp7cxtk-SnmGbGUKw&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Hong Zhou"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Case analysis of the Cpan dataset: (a) the original graph; (b) our AdaMotif.

For large hypergraphs, it is often difficult to visually detect structures within the data. Recently, a scalable polygon-based visualization approach was developed allowing hypergraphs with thousands of hyperedges to be simplified and examined at different levels of detail. However, this approach is not guaranteed to eliminate all of the visual clutter caused by unavoidable overlaps. Furthermore, meaningful structures can be lost at simplified scales, making their interpretation unreliable. In this paper, we define hypergraph structures using the bipartite graph representation, allowing us to decompose the hypergraph into a union of structures including topological blocks, bridges, and branches, and to identify exactly where unavoidable overlaps must occur. We also introduce a set of topology preserving and topology altering atomic operations, enabling the preservation of important structures while reducing unavoidable overlaps to improve visual clarity and interpretability in simplified scales.

However, formulating effective query expressions remains a challenge for multivariate hierarchical data, particularly when datasets become very large. To address this issue, we develop a declarative grammar,HiRegEx (Hierarchical data Regular Expression), for querying and exploring multivariate hierarchical data. Rooted in the extended multi-level task topology framework for tree visualizations (e-MLTT), HiRegEx delineates three query targets (node, path, and subtree) and two aspects for querying these targets (features and positions), and uses operators developed based on classical regular expressions for query construction. Based on the HiRegEx grammar, we develop an exploratory framework for querying and exploring multivariate hierarchical data and integrate it into the TreeQueryER prototype system. The exploratory framework includes three major components: top-down pattern specification, bottom-up data-driven inquiry, and context-creation data overview. We validate the expressiveness of HiRegEx with the tasks from the e-MLTT framework and showcase the utility and effectiveness ofTreeQueryER system through a case study involving expert users in the analysis of a citation tree dataset.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"email":"guozhg.li@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guozheng Li"},{"affiliations":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"email":"haotian.mi1@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"haotian mi"},{"affiliations":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"email":"liuchi02@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chi Harold Liu"},{"affiliations":["Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan"],"email":"itot@is.ocha.ac.jp","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Takayuki Itoh"},{"affiliations":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"email":"wanggrbit@126.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoren Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1831/v-full-1831_Preview.mp4?token=n9QVeFNmeHdmGxNyALHyOSelyM2wK96nkpNFEk5JK20&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1831/v-full-1831_Preview.srt?token=ZgipMgJhWQR58B78D58zTFJOIAOOffNjTYK6RJMyoOA&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Haotian Mi"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The exploratory framework for querying multivariate hierarchical data comprises three modes: top-down, bottom-up, and context-creation.

There are a few existing methods that attempt to develop a flexible solution for optimizing different aesthetic aspects measured by different aesthetic criteria. Furthermore, thanks to the significant advance in deep learning techniques, several deep learning-based layout methods were proposed recently, which have demonstrated the advantages of the deep learning approaches for graph drawing. However, none of these existing methods can be directly applied to optimizing non-differentiable criteria without special accommodation. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning framework for graph drawing, called SmartGD, which can optimize any quantitative aesthetic goals even though they are non-differentiable. In the cases where the aesthetic goal is too abstract to be described mathematically, SmartGD can draw graphs in a similar style as a collection of good layout examples, which might be selected by humans based on the abstract aesthetic goal. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartGD, we conduct experiments on minimizing stress, minimizing edge crossing, maximizing crossing angle, and a combination of multiple aesthetics. Compared with several popular graph drawing algorithms, the experimental results show that SmartGD achieves good performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xiaoqi Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kevin Yen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yifan Hu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233306356/v-tvcg-20233306356_Preview.mp4?token=4FeNN97BbtmlhvsZMB10GJ5NdeysTGNjtZGcEi2MjHk&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233306356/v-tvcg-20233306356_Preview.srt?token=e0TXzPdvcYtaKAftmwaAOpQueUFI2YNUVbmpC3fSPn8&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Xiaoqi Wang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3306356","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"SmartGD is a novel deep-learning framework for graph drawing, which can optimize any quantitative aesthetics.

A few scene abstractions have been proposed, but they are restricted to specific applications for a limited set of visualization types. A unified and expressive model of data visualization scenes for different applications has been missing.

Across a suite of backing LLMs, we find that DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend moderately agree with each other, but both substantially diverge from guidelines drawn from human subjects experiments.

There is an increasing trend in leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve an end-to-end visualization recommendation. However, existing ML-based approaches implicitly assume that there is only one appropriate visualization for a specific dataset, which is often not true for real applications. Also, they often work like a black box, and are difficult for users to understand the reasons for recommending specific visualizations. To fill the research gap, we propose AdaVis, an adaptive and explainable approach to recommend one or multiple appropriate visualizations for a tabular dataset. It leverages a box embedding-based knowledge graph to well model the possible one-to-many mapping relations among different entities (i.e., data features, dataset columns, datasets, and visualization choices). The embeddings of the entities and relations can be learned from dataset-visualization pairs. Also, AdaVis incorporates the attention mechanism into the inference framework. Attention can indicate the relative importance of data features for a dataset and provide fine-grained explainability. Our extensive evaluations through quantitative metric evaluations, case studies, and user interviews demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaVis.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Songheng Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yong Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haotian Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233316469/v-tvcg-20233316469_Preview.mp4?token=wCwBEW6oJAqCGaF_7k5HslvCKP45i5gj1POdYH9qKtc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233316469/v-tvcg-20233316469_Preview.srt?token=djcHDOkGOsLAPdzbvC_3CO12Lcv1PjuJHjIGl_j0bV4&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Songheng Zhang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3316469","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"The figures show four pairs of visualizations recommended for four different datasets.

Among the many contributions proposed in this area, some systems embrace the ambitious objective of imitating human analysts to identify relevant relationships in data and make appropriate design choices to represent these relationships with insightful charts. We denote these systems as \"agnostic\" VRSs since they do not rely on human-provided constraints and rules but try to learn the task autonomously. Despite the high application potential of agnostic VRSs, their progress is hindered by several obstacles, including the absence of standardized datasets to train recommendation algorithms, the difficulty of learning design rules, and defining quantitative criteria for evaluating the perceptual effectiveness of generated plots. This paper summarizes the literature on agnostic VRSs and outlines promising future research directions.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Luca Podo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bardh Prenkaj"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Paola Velardi"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243374571/v-tvcg-20243374571_Preview.mp4?token=KLfl87EHjbGIpm2yPdsmIpwf2cM0nXpQgl2CbVHhXKA&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243374571/v-tvcg-20243374571_Preview.srt?token=K44xpC8trhsmHcAEor-rRfBqY382d4LraLLQEK7M2gY&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Luca Podo"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3374571","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Workflow of Agnostic Visual Recommender Systems (A-VRSs): First (Figure 1 up), the model is trained with data-visualization pairs, to learn both to identify relevant relationships between data and to visualize them in the best possible way.

To address this issue, we propose a new representation model, Chart2Vec, to learn a universal embedding of visualizations with context-aware information. Chart2Vec aims to support a wide range of downstream visualization tasks such as recommendation and storytelling. Our model considers both structural and semantic information of visualizations in declarative specifications. To enhance the context-aware capability, Chart2Vec employs multi-task learning on both supervised and unsupervised tasks concerning the cooccurrence of visualizations.

Evaluating individual risk profiles necessitates a deeper understanding of the interplay between different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor location and spread, and risk of subsequent toxicities that can not be adequately captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning digital twin (DT) to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system. We evaluate the efficacy of DITTO through quantitative evaluation of performance and case studies with qualitative feedback.

Such an optimization is governed by multiple, conflicting objectives and it is performed across a multi-dimensional parameter space.The extent of the parameter space, the complexity of the non-linear model of the system,as well as the time needed per simulation run and factors that are not modeled in the simulation necessitate an iterative, semi-automatic approach. We present an interactive visual optimization approach, where the user works with a p-h diagram to steer an iterative, guided optimization process. A deep learning (DL) model provides estimates for parameters, given a target characterization of the system, while numerical simulation is used to compute system characteristics for an ensemble of parameter sets. Since the DL model only serves as an approximation of the inverse of the cooling system and since target characteristics can be chosen according to different, competing objectives, an iterative optimization process is realized, developing multiple sets of intermediate solutions, which are visually related to each other.The standard p-h diagram, integrated interactively in this approach, is complemented by a dual, also interactive visual representation of additional expressive measures representing the system characteristics. We show how the known four-points semantic of the p-h diagram meaningfully transfers to the dual data representation.When evaluating this approach in the automotive domain, we found that our solution helped with the overall comprehension of the cooling system and that it lead to a faster convergence during optimization.

However, quantum circuits, which are fundamental for implementing quantum algorithms, can be challenging for users to understand due to their underlying logic, such as the temporal evolution of quantum states and the effect of quantum amplitudes on the probability of basis quantum states. To fill this research gap, we propose QuantumEyes, an interactive visual analytics system to enhance the interpretability of quantum circuits through both global and local levels. For the global-level analysis, we present three coupled visualizations to delineate the changes of quantum states and the underlying reasons: a Probability Summary View to overview the probability evolution of quantum states; a State Evolution View to enable an in-depth analysis of the influence of quantum gates on the quantum states; a Gate Explanation View to show the individual qubit states and facilitate a better understanding of the effect of quantum gates. For the local-level analysis, we design a novel geometrical visualization dandelion chart to explicitly reveal how the quantum amplitudes affect the probability of the quantum state. We thoroughly evaluated QuantumEyes as well as the novel dandelion chart integrated into it through two case studies on different types of quantum algorithms and in-depth expert interviews with 12 domain experts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach in enhancing the interpretability of quantum circuits.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shaolun Ruan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qiang Guan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Paul Griffin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ying Mao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yong Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233332999/v-tvcg-20233332999_Preview.mp4?token=KYsEFgeyQN1AgvlKSQJWtfU9VAyZfND8R6jfQJvuAe8&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233332999/v-tvcg-20233332999_Preview.srt?token=IKfsu3IkAuw3dU6k3iBiR4xWulNiC-UvBTMwRRQGTXo&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Shaolun Ruan"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3332999","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"We propose QuantumEyes, an interactive visualization system to enhance the interpretability of general quantum circuits, with the integration of a visual design called Dandelion Chart to explain the quantum states regarding the probability and amplitudes of each basis states.","keywords":["Data visualization, design study, interpretability, quantum computing."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, PCS","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07980","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full2","slot_id":"v-tvcg-20233332999","time_end":"2024-10-17T18:09:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T17:57:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T17:57:00Z","title":"QuantumEyes: Towards Better Interpretability of Quantum Circuits","uid":"v-tvcg-20233332999","youtube_ff_id":"SPYRqbzGtdA","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/SPYRqbzGtdA","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TNqponA2lk?start=842"},{"abstract":"Visualization design studies bring together visualization researchers and domain experts to address yet unsolved data analysis challenges stemming from the needs of the domain experts. Typically, the visualization researchers lead the design study process and implementation of any visualization solutions. This setup leverages the visualization researchers' knowledge of methodology, design, and programming, but the availability to synchronize with the domain experts can hamper the design process. We consider an alternative setup where the domain experts take the lead in the design study, supported by the visualization experts. In this study, the domain experts are computer architecture experts who simulate and analyze novel computer chip designs. These chips rely on a Network-on-Chip (NOC) to connect components. The experts want to understand how the chip designs perform and what in the design led to their performance. To aid this analysis, we develop Vis4Mesh, a visualization system that provides spatial, temporal, and architectural context to simulated NOC behavior. Integration with an existing computer architecture visualization tool enables architects to perform deep-dives into specific architecture component behavior. We validate Vis4Mesh through a case study and a user study with computer architecture researchers.

Our domain scientists are going beyond traditional methods by employing both X-ray and neutron computed tomography to obtain complementary representations expected to better resolve material boundaries. However, the use of two modalities creates its own challenges for visualization, requiring either complex adjustments of multimodal transfer functions or the need for multiple views. Together with experts in nondestructive evaluation, we designed a novel interactive multimodal visualization approach to create a combined view of the co-registered X-ray and neutron acquisitions of industrial objects. Using an automatic topological segmentation of the bivariate histogram of X-ray and neutron values as a starting point, the system provides a simple yet effective interface to easily create, explore, and adjust a multimodal isualization. We propose a widget with simple brushing interactions that enables the user to quickly correct the segmented histogram results. Our semiautomated system enables domain experts to intuitively explore large multimodal datasets without the need for either advanced segmentation algorithms or knowledge of visualization echniques. We demonstrate our approach using synthetic examples, industrial phantom objects created to stress multimodal scanning techniques, and real-world objects, and we discuss expert feedback.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huang, Xuan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Miao, Haichao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kim, Hyojin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Townsend, Andrew"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Champley, Kyle"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tringe, Joseph"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pascucci, Valerio"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bremer, Peer-Timo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243382607/v-tvcg-20243382607_Preview.mp4?token=tXtWD-Fz0i8u7eIfUdgouiGgwZ7L-nJDcmSmrOsmXGY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243382607/v-tvcg-20243382607_Preview.srt?token=aqpJ-RnPiFguRY97IwuBpLjy2Yk82W6DC49AwGefdOI&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Xuan Huang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3382607","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"The X-Ray and neutron computed tomography industrial object XR05, consisting of multiple materials and intrinsic structures.

However, consumers of visualizations often draw causal conclusions when only correlations between variables are shown. In this paper, we investigate factors that contribute to causal relationships users perceive in visualizations. We collected a corpus of concept pairs from variables in widely used datasets and created visualizations that depict varying correlative associations using three typical statistical chart types. We conducted two MTurk studies on (1) preconceived notions on causal relations without charts, and (2) perceived causal relations with charts, for each concept pair. Our results indicate that people make assumptions about causal relationships between pairs of concepts even without seeing any visualized data. Moreover, our results suggest that these assumptions constitute causal priors that, in combination with visualized association, impact how data visualizations are interpreted. The results also suggest that causal priors may lead to over- or under-estimation in perceived causal relations in different circumstances, and that those priors can also impact users' confidence in their causal assessments. In addition, our results align with prior work, indicating that chart type may also affect causal inference. Using data from the studies, we develop a model to capture the interaction between causal priors and visualized associations as they combine to impact a user's perceived causal relations. In addition to reporting the study results and analyses, we provide an open dataset of causal priors for 56 specific concept pairs that can serve as a potential benchmark for future studies.

Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic.

In two experiments, we examine individuals\u2019 accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples.

However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality.

Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms \u201c judgment \u201d and \u201c decision making \u201d are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence people's judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.

We present KnowledgeVIS , a human-in-the-loop visual analytics system for interpreting language models using fill-in-the-blank sentences as prompts. By comparing predictions between sentences, KnowledgeVIS reveals learned associations that intuitively connect what language models learn during training to natural language tasks downstream, helping users create and test multiple prompt variations, analyze predicted words using a novel semantic clustering technique, and discover insights using interactive visualizations. Collectively, these visualizations help users identify the likelihood and uniqueness of individual predictions, compare sets of predictions between prompts, and summarize patterns and relationships between predictions across all prompts. We demonstrate the capabilities of KnowledgeVIS with feedback from six NLP experts as well as three different use cases: (1) probing biomedical knowledge in two domain-adapted models; and (2) evaluating harmful identity stereotypes and (3) discovering facts and relationships between three general-purpose models.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adam Coscia"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alex Endert"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233346713/v-tvcg-20233346713_Preview.mp4?token=f6g5iPvFyz17qSg3QF89xpvfwdqLRXE7iBD5fJRN3Vc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233346713/v-tvcg-20233346713_Preview.srt?token=s6wQXlGhwA-bODTFxNuCgLFi6qsuY_1vOZA_vJAaRZ0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Adam Coscia"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3346713","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Evaluating generative LLMs for stereotypes and biases is hard.

A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison, including tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in model behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To support real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual system called Compress and Compare. Within a single interface, Compress and Compare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced behavior changes by comparing models\u2019 predictions, weights, and activations. We demonstrate how Compress and Compare supports common compression analysis tasks through two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language models and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models. We further evaluate Compress and Compare in a user study with eight compression experts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression workflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage thorough analysis of compression\u2019s effect on model behavior. Through these evaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual analytics tools should consider and Compress and Compare visualizations that may generalize to broader model comparison tasks.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"aboggust@mit.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Angie Boggust"},{"affiliations":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"vsivaram@andrew.cmu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Venkatesh Sivaraman"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"yassogba@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yannick Assogba"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Seattle, United States"],"email":"donghao@apple.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Donghao Ren"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Seattle, United States"],"email":"fred.hohman@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fred Hohman"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1142/v-full-1142_Preview.mp4?token=7bLX7TtYd-7Di9wJoeHtOTxkKehZFEDVJj3D4r93Uoo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1142/v-full-1142_Preview.srt?token=sApfAyEMxtKgQ5SzPXgHjhpIke2I3KKtKRVsbusIKtk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Angie Boggust"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Compress and Compare helps ML practitioners analyze and compare compression experiments.

While advancements have been made in computational efficiency as well as diversity and convergence of solutions, a critical challenge persists: the internal evolutionary mechanisms are opaque to human users. Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex algorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying evolutionary operators and population dynamics within MOEAs aligns well with a visual analytics paradigm. This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs. Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations. In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"zhangzr32021@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zherui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"yangf2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fan Yang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"ranchengcn@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ran Cheng"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"mayx@sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuxin Ma"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1179/v-full-1179_Preview.mp4?token=HiWFcD9cnvwRDeNVeu8K30udpLarCgMmf95DedtPB38&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fan Yang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We introduce ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to illustrate the dynamics of population generations within evolutionary processes of MOEAs, which consists of three main components: Performance Overview and Generation Statistics (A) Visual Exploration of Individuals among Generations (B) In-depth Visual Inspection of Operators (C).","keywords":["Visual analytics, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, evolutionary computation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/VIS-SUSTech/ParetoTracker","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, external","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04539","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full21","slot_id":"v-full-1179","time_end":"2024-10-17T13:42:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T13:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T13:30:00Z","title":"ParetoTracker: Understanding Population Dynamics in Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms through Visual Analytics","uid":"v-full-1179","youtube_ff_id":"iExTSj-IaHc","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/iExTSj-IaHc","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ESst2nxcXuA?start=4104"},{"abstract":"Providing effective guidance for users has long been an important and challenging task for efficient exploratory visual analytics, especially when selecting variables for visualization in high-dimensional datasets. Correlation is the most widely applied metric for guidance in statistical and analytical tools, however a reliance on correlation may lead users towards false positives when interpreting causal relations in the data. In this work, inspired by prior insights on the benefits of counterfactual visualization in supporting visual causal inference, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient counterfactual guidance method to enhance causal inference performance in guided exploratory analytics based on insights and concerns gathered from expert interviews. Our technique aims to capitalize on the benefits of counterfactual approaches while reducing their complexity for users. We integrated counterfactual guidance into an exploratory visual analytics system, and using a synthetically generated ground-truth causal dataset, conducted a comparative user study and evaluated to what extent counterfactual guidance can help lead users to more precise visual causal inferences. The results suggest that counterfactual guidance improved visual causal inference performance, and also led to different exploratory behaviors compared to correlation-based guidance. Based on these findings, we offer future directions and challenges for incorporating counterfactual guidance to better support exploratory visual analytics.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliations":["UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"borland@renci.org","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Borland"},{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"gotz@unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Gotz"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1258/v-full-1258_Preview.mp4?token=VYZkWSazuZO9S5NwEeptlwzOFMY2nnIEGDfaeGEKwyY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1258/v-full-1258_Preview.srt?token=pMJxvpJBUzRXIXcEYTAns27ai8gHIQp3yOwkNGtXc58&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Arran Zeyu Wang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The proposed counterfactual guidance technique is compared with traditional correlation-based guidance through five scenarios.

We conducted two empirical experiments to investigate individuals\u2019 ability to visually validate linear regression models (linear trends) and to examine the impact of common visualization designs on validation quality. The first experiment showed that the level of accuracy for visual estimation of slope (i.e., fitting a line to data) is higher than for visual validation of slope (i.e., accepting a shown line). Notably, we found bias toward slopes that are \u201ctoo steep\u201d in both cases. This lead to novel insights that participants naturally assessed regression with orthogonal distances between the points and the line (i.e., ODR regression) rather than the common vertical distances (OLS regression). In the second experiment, we investigated whether incorporating common designs for regression visualization (error lines, bounding boxes, and confidence intervals) would improve visual validation. Even though error lines reduced validation bias, results failed to show the desired improvements in accuracy for any design. Overall, our findings suggest caution in using visual model validation for linear trends in scatterplots.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"braun@cs.uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Daniel Braun"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"remco@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"affiliations":["University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, United States"],"email":"gleicher@cs.wisc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Gleicher"},{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"landesberger@cs.uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tatiana von Landesberger"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1547/v-full-1547_Preview.mp4?token=SSXo5mnJOmbYrf5k4_9Y7_5zEcT5DmSz-KJd7OTPcyo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1547/v-full-1547_Preview.srt?token=LLrihZt2TX9EdY69thgGKMo33P18_McHP5ewTqId8Cc&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Daniel Braun"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"\u201cVisual summary\u201d of visual validation and estimation accuracy for linear trends in scatterplots.

Based on a confocal microscopy dataset, traditionally biologists manually constructed the cell lineage, starting from this observation and reasoning backward in time to establish their inheritance. To speed up this tedious process, we make use of machine learning (ML) models trained on a database of manually established cell lineages to assist the biologist in cell assignment. Most biologists, however, are not familiar with ML, nor is it clear to them which model best predicts the embryo's development. We thus have developed a visualization system that is designed to support biologists in exploring and comparing ML models, checking the model predictions, detecting possible ML model mistakes, and deciding on the most likely embryo development. To evaluate our proposed system, we deployed our interface with six biologists in an observational study.

The use of interactive touchscreen exhibits in informal learning environments, such as museums and science centers, often incorporate frameworks that classify learning processes, such as Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, to achieve better user engagement and knowledge transfer. To analyze user behavior within these digital environments, interaction logs are recorded to capture diverse exploration strategies. However, analysis of such logs is challenging, especially in terms of coupling interactions and cognitive learning processes, and existing work within learning and educational contexts remains limited. To address these gaps, we develop a visual analytics approach for analyzing interaction logs that supports exploration at the individual user level and multi-user comparison. The approach utilizes algorithmic methods to identify similarities in users' interactions and reveal their exploration strategies. We motivate and illustrate our approach through an application scenario, using event sequences derived from interaction log data in an experimental study conducted with science center visitors from diverse backgrounds and demographics. The study involves 14 users completing tasks of increasing complexity, designed to stimulate different levels of cognitive learning processes. We implement our approach in an interactive visual analytics prototype system, named VISID, and together with domain experts, discover a set of task-solving exploration strategies, such as \"cascading\" and \"nested-loop\", which reflect different levels of learning processes from Bloom's taxonomy. Finally, we discuss the generalizability and scalability of the presented system and the need for further research with data acquired in the wild.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"peilin.yu@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Peilin Yu"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"aida.vitoria@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aida Nordman"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"marta.koc-januchta@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marta M.

Task abstractions can help us go beyond domain-specific details, but existing visualization task abstractions are insufficient for event sequence visual analytics because they primarily focus on multivariate datasets and often overlook automated analytical techniques. To address this gap, we propose a domain-agnostic multi-level task framework for event sequence analytics, derived from an analysis of 58 papers that present event sequence visualization systems. Our framework consists of four levels: objective, intent, strategy, and technique. Overall objectives identify the main goals of analysis. Intents comprises five high-level approaches adopted at each analysis step: augment data, simplify data, configure data, configure visualization, and manage provenance. Each intent is accomplished through a number of strategies, for instance, data simplification can be achieved through aggregation, summarization, or segmentation. Finally, each strategy can be implemented by a set of techniques depending on the input and output components. We further show that each technique can be expressed through a quartet of action-input-output-criteria. We demonstrate the framework\u2019s descriptive power through case studies and discuss its similarities and differences with previous event sequence task taxonomies.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, United States"],"email":"kzintas@umd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kazi Tasnim Zinat"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"ssakhamu@terpmail.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Saimadhav Naga Sakhamuri"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"achen151@terpmail.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aaron Sun Chen"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"leozcliu@umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhicheng Liu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1642/v-full-1642_Preview.mp4?token=6EC8R0dh9lTx_Yo63GE8xfzo74rMtLPiKE-sX05YXik&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1642/v-full-1642_Preview.srt?token=DCfmsMRFf68vDodSJcDYHRDq3OopfC9esYpGXacq6as&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Kazi Tasnim Zinat"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"From bigger picture to finer details Our four-tier framework consists of four levels: Objectives, Intents, Strategies, and Techniques, providing a common language to enhance cross-domain collaboration and tool evaluation.","keywords":["Task Abstraction, Event Sequence Data"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/bkjsc/?view_only=b95871b8c4ae497ab9b6cb565e28edf5","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, external","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full22","slot_id":"v-full-1642","time_end":"2024-10-16T14:51:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:39:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T14:39:00Z","title":"A Multi-Level Task Framework for Event Sequence Analysis","uid":"v-full-1642","youtube_ff_id":"4WP9eGQ_hwI","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/4WP9eGQ_hwI","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M8JHVCnERRk?start=1516"},{"abstract":"We conduct two in-lab experiments (N=93) to evaluate the effectiveness of Gantt charts, extended Gantt charts, and stringline charts for visualizing fixed-order event sequence data. We first formulate five types of event sequences and define three types of sequence elements: point events, interval events, and the temporal gaps between them. Our two experiments focus on event sequences with a pre-defined, fixed order, and measure task error rates and completion time. The first experiment shows single sequences and assesses the three charts' performance in comparing event duration or gap. The second experiment shows multiple sequences and evaluates how well the charts reveal temporal patterns. The results suggest that when visualizing single fixed-order event sequences, 1) Gantt and extended Gantt charts lead to comparable error rates in the duration-comparing task; 2) Gantt charts exhibit either shorter or equal completion time than extended Gantt charts; 3) both Gantt and extended Gantt charts demonstrate shorter completion times than stringline charts; 4) however, stringline charts outperform the other two charts with fewer errors in the comparing task when event type counts are high. Additionally, when visualizing multiple point-based fixed-order event sequences, stringline charts require less time than Gantt charts for people to find temporal patterns. Based on these findings, we discuss design opportunities for visualizing fixed-order event sequences and discuss future avenues for optimizing these charts.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Junxiu Tang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fumeng Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiang Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yifang Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiayi Zhou"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiwen Cai"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lingyun Yu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243358919/v-tvcg-20243358919_Preview.mp4?token=YP7eNz4W93N5GiZNwbr-U7L-UQEm6jMkbOb3v4o0YBQ&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243358919/v-tvcg-20243358919_Preview.srt?token=MxOnHDpxuV2ztsYfQDv6pLK3RFbuY1mUEGyHlXl0UCU&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Junxiu Tang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3358919","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"In two lab experiments with 93 participants, we assessed the performance of Gantt, extended Gantt, and stringline charts for visualizing fixed-order event sequences.

TSEQs exist in application domains, such as sleeping behavior, earthquake aftershocks, and stock market crashes. Domain experts face four challenges, for which they could use interactive and visual data analysis methods. First, TSEQs can be large with respect to both the number of sequences and events, often leading to millions of events. Second, domain experts need validated metrics and features to identify interesting patterns. Third, after identifying interesting patterns, domain experts contextualize the patterns to foster sensemaking. Finally, domain experts seek to reduce data complexity by data simplification and machine learning support. We present IVESA, a visual analytics approach for TSEQs. It supports the analysis of TSEQs at the granularities of sequences and events, supported with metrics and feature analysis tools. IVESA has multiple linked views that support overview, sort+filter, comparison, details-on-demand, and metadata relation-seeking tasks, as well as data simplification through feature analysis, interactive clustering, filtering, and motif detection and simplification. We evaluated IVESA with three case studies and a user study with six domain experts working with six different datasets and applications.

However, prior empirical studies have only investigated abstract data encoded in physical form (e.g., laser cut bar charts) and not continuously sampled spatial data fields relevant to climate and medical science (e.g., heights, temperatures, densities, and velocities sampled on a spatial grid). This paper presents the design and results of the first study to characterize human performance in 3D spatial data analysis tasks across analogous physical and digital visualizations. Participants analyzed continuous spatial elevation data with three visualization modalities: (1) 2D digital visualization; (2) perspective-tracked, stereoscopic \"fishtank\" virtual reality; and (3) 3D printed data physicalization. Their tasks included tracing paths downhill, looking up spatial locations and comparing their relative heights, and identifying and reporting the minimum and maximum heights within certain spatial regions. As hypothesized, in most cases, participants performed the tasks just as well or better in the physical modality (based on time and error metrics). Additional results include an analysis of open-ended feedback from participants and discussion of implications for further research on the value of data physicalization.

Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) catalyzes haptic interactions on surface visualizations. Various interaction modes, encompassing both mid-air and on-surface interactions---with or without the application of assisting force stimuli---have been explored using haptic force feedback devices. In this paper, we evaluate the use of on-surface and assisted on-surface haptic modes of interaction compared to a no-haptic interaction mode. A force-based haptic stylus is used for all three modalities; the on-surface mode uses collision based forces, whereas the assisted on-surface mode is accompanied by an additional snapping force. We conducted a within-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across all three modes, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took almost the same time to brush curves using all the interaction modes. They could draw smoother curves using the on-surface interaction modes compared to the no-haptic mode. However, the assisted on-surface mode provided better accuracy than the on-surface mode. The on-surface mode was slower in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant feedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share takeaways to aid the design of haptics-based tangible interactions for surface visualizations.

As refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) become cheaper and conversational agents continue to improve, their combination provides a promising approach to support BLV people's interactive data exploration and analysis. To understand how BLV people would use and react to a system combining an RTD with a conversational agent, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with 11 BLV participants, where they interacted with line charts, bar charts, and isarithmic maps. Our analysis of participants' interactions led to the identification of nine distinct patterns. We also learned that the choice of modalities depended on the type of task and prior experience with tactile graphics, and that participants strongly preferred the combination of RTD and speech to a single modality. In addition, participants with more tactile experience described how tactile images facilitated a deeper engagement with the data and supported independent interpretation. Our findings will inform the design of interfaces for such interactive mixed-modality systems.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"samuel.reinders@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Samuel Reinders"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"matthew.butler@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthew Butler"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Clayton, Australia"],"email":"ingrid.zukerman@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ingrid Zukerman"},{"affiliations":["Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","Microsoft Research, Redmond, United States"],"email":"b.lee@yonsei.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bongshin Lee"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"lizhen.qu@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lizhen Qu"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"kim.marriott@monash.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kim Marriott"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1522/v-full-1522_Preview.mp4?token=SEEy97d0dqlKpk3cT4vIQZNToqbJOTSBwqAygXATai4&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Kim Marriott"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We explored how refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) can be combined with conversational agents to assist people who are blind or have low vision (BLV) in undertaking data analysis activities.

Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures---often at multiple spatial or semantic scales---across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction, including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof, to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights. As a result, we provide our design suggestions for the cross-reality environment, emphasizing the interaction with diverse visual representations and seamless interaction transitions between 2D and 3D spaces.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"lixiang.zhao17@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lixiang Zhao"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Orsay, France","Inria, Saclay, France"],"email":"tobias.isenberg@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"fuqi.xie20@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fuqi Xie"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"hainingliang@hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hai-Ning Liang"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"lingyun.yu@xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lingyun Yu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1626/v-full-1626_Preview.mp4?token=sK3xgzYvz9vy3e12YjM6EeAlIsksBkwUQRHAkZSg-e0&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1626/v-full-1626_Preview.srt?token=nNi8GNmk5EYUK_KG5cb0-5UOBQf0CamZesLxXXKI1Zo&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Lixiang Zhao"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"SpatialTouch is a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations.

However, the inherent visual nature of the charts creates barriers for people with visual impairments to reap the associated benefits to the same extent as their sighted peers. While extant research has predominantly focused on understanding and addressing these barriers for blind screen reader users, the needs of low-vision screen magnifier users have been largely overlooked. In an interview study, almost all low-vision participants stated that it was challenging to interact with data charts on small screen devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though they could technically \u201csee\u201d the chart content. They ascribed these challenges mainly to the magnification induced loss of visual context that connected data points with each other and also with chart annotations, e.g., axis values. In this paper, we present a method that addresses this problem by automatically transforming charts that are typically non-interactive images into personalizable interactive charts which allow selective viewing of desired data points and preserve visual context as much as possible under screen enlargement. We evaluated our method in a usability study with 26 low-vision participants, who all performed a set of representative chart-related tasks under different study conditions. In the study, we observed that our method significantly improved the usability of charts over both the status quo screen magnifier and a state-of-the-art space compaction-based solution.

While prior research predominantly focuses on the needs of the visually impaired, our survey aims to broaden this scope by investigating accessible data representations across a more inclusive spectrum of disabilities. After conducting a systematic review of 152 accessible data representation papers from ACM and IEEE databases, we found that roughly 78% of existing articles center on vision impairments. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the remaining 22% of papers focused on underrepresented disability communities. We developed categorical dimensions based on accessibility, visualization, and human-computer interaction to classify the papers. These dimensions include the community of focus, issues addressed, contribution type, study methods, participants, data type, visualization type, and data domain. Our work redefines accessible data representations by illustrating their application for disabilities beyond those related to vision. Building on our literature review, we identify and discuss opportunities for future research in accessible data representations.

Previous work has shown that speech commands, alone or in combination with other input modalities, can support visual data exploration by individuals. However, it is still unknown whether and how speech commands can be used in collaboration, and for what tasks. To answer these questions, we developed a functioning prototype that we used as a technology probe. We conducted an in-depth exploratory study with 10 participant pairs to analyze their interaction choices, the interplay between the input modalities, and their collaboration. While touch was the most used modality, we found that participants preferred speech commands for global operations, used them for distant interaction, and that speech interaction contributed to the awareness of the partner\u2019s actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of using speech commands during collaboration was related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Regarding collaboration styles, participants interacted with speech equally often whether they were in loosely or closely coupled collaboration. While the partners stood closer to each other during close collaboration, they did not distance themselves to use speech commands. From our findings, we derive and contribute a set of design considerations for collaborative and multimodal interactive data analysis systems.

To empower students to fully leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT in educational scenarios, understanding students\u2019 interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the absence of datasets focused on student-ChatGPT conversations and the complexities in identifying and analyzing the evolutional interaction patterns within conversations. To address these challenges, we collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master\u2019s level data visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme, grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students\u2019 interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT\u2019s responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. We validated the system\u2019s effectiveness through expert interviews with six data visualization instructors and three case studies. The results confirmed StuGPTViz\u2019s capacity to enhance educators\u2019 insights into the pedagogical value of ChatGPT.

Despite advancements in AI model accuracy, there is still a significant need among domain experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that align better with domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the high costs of experimentation. To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with two key components: 1) Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2) Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids experts in organizing and comparing predictions and interpretive paths across different granularities, uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. Facilitated by SLInterpreter, this framework ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration.

We introduce a novel method for documenting collaborative data meetings that treats deixis as a first-class citizen. Our proposed framework captures cursor-based gestural data along with audio and converts them into interactive documents. The framework leverages a large language model to identify word correspondences with gestures. These identified references are used to create context-based annotations in the resulting interactive document. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed method through a user study, finding that participants preferred our automated interactive documentation over recordings, transcripts, and manual note-taking. Furthermore, we derive a preliminary taxonomy of cursor-based deictic gestures from participant actions during the study.

Inspired by the daily use of e-mail, V-Mail seeks to enable a similar style of rapid, multi-person communication accessible on any device; however, it aims to do this in the new context of spatial 3D communication, where limited access to 3D graphics hardware typically prevents such communication. The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration, spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail ``data stories'' are exported in a standard video file format to establish a common baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client, implemented as a plugin. Results and evaluation from applying V-Mail to assist communication within an interdisciplinary science team studying Antarctic ice sheets confirm the utility of the asynchronous, cross-platform collaborative framework while also highlighting some current limitations and opportunities for future work.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jung Who Nam"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Daniel F.

DeLVE uses a new visualization idiom, Connected Multi-Tier Ranges, to visualize curated datasets of past events across multiple scales of time, relating extreme scales with concrete scales that have more familiar magnitudes and units. Museum staff at three separate museums approved the deployment of DeLVE as a digital kiosk, and devoted time to curating a unique dataset in each of them. We collect data from two sources, an observational study and system trace logs. We discuss the importance of context: similar museum exhibits in different contexts were received very differently by visitors. We additionally discuss differences in our process from Sedlmair et al.'s design study methodology which is focused on design studies triggered by connection with collaborators rather than the discovery of a concept to communicate.

In recent years, more and more researchers have explored many narrative structures for effective and attractive data storytelling. Meanwhile, the Hero's Journey provides a classic narrative framework specific to the Hero's story that has been adopted by various mediums. There are continuous discussions about applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages, sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants were invited to design data videos with and without our design space guidance, which was evaluated by two experts. Results show that our design space provides useful and practical guidance for data storytellers effectively creating data videos with the Hero's Journey.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"email":"zwei302@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Zheng Wei"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"xxubq@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xian Xu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1333/v-full-1333_Preview.mp4?token=fETBO1EkdBunsDoPRjp9sEM_y_dQMiu_zH8vQNcA_3E&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Zheng Wei"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Applying the Hero's Journey as a framework for creating data videos, we organize a design space into three segments (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return), grounded in the narrative structure of the Hero's Journey.

In this work, we seek to address this vacuum through a controlled study. We asked participants to repeatedly perform four different tasks with four table representation conditions (plain tables, tables with zebra striping, tables with cell background color encoding cell value, and tables with in-cell bars with lengths encoding cell value). We analyzed completion time, error rate, gaze-tracking data, mouse movement and participant preferences. We found that color and bar encodings help for finding maximum values. For a more complex task (comparison of proportional differences) color and bar helped less than zebra striping. We also characterize typical human behavior for the four tasks.

Such context awareness is particularly useful for ubiquitous and immersive analytics where knowing which embedded visualizations the user is looking at can be used to make visualizations react appropriately to the user\u2019s attention: for example, by highlighting data the user has not yet seen. We can separate the approach into three components: (1) measuring the user\u2019s gaze on a visualization and its parts; (2) tracking the user\u2019s attention over time; and (3) reactively modifying the visual representation based on the current attention metric. In this paper, we present two separate implementations of AAV: a 2D data-agnostic method for web-based visualizations that can use an embodied eyetracker to capture the user\u2019s gaze, and a 3D data-aware one that uses the stencil buffer to track the visibility of each individual mark in a visualization. Both methods provide similar mechanisms for accumulating attention over time and changing the appearance of marks in response. We also present results from a qualitative evaluation studying visual feedback and triggering mechanisms for capturing and revisualizing attention.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"email":"arvind@cs.au.dk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Arvind Srinivasan"},{"affiliations":["Aarhus University, Aarhus N, Denmark"],"email":"johannes@ellemose.eu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Johannes Ellemose"},{"affiliations":["Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom"],"email":"p.butcher@bangor.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Peter W.

This design decision may be due to the lack of relevance of vertical scaling in normal PDFs. In fact, as long as two normal PDFs have the same means and standard deviations (SDs), they can be scaled to occupy different amounts of vertical space while still remaining statistically identical. Because unfixed PDF height increases as SD decreases, visualization designers may find themselves tempted to vertically shrink low-SD PDFs to avoid occlusion or save white space in their figures. Although irregular vertical scaling has been explored in bar and line charts, the visualization community has yet to investigate how this visual manipulation may affect reader comparisons of PDFs. In this paper, we present two preregistered experiments (n = 600, n = 401) that systematically demonstrate that vertical scaling can lead to misinterpretations of PDFs. We also test visual interventions to mitigate misinterpretation. In some contexts, we find including a y-axis can help reduce this effect. Overall, we find that keeping vertical scaling consistent, and therefore maintaining equal pixel areas under PDF curves, results in the highest likelihood of accurate comparisons. Our findings provide insights into the impact of vertical scaling on PDFs, and reveal the complicated nature of proportional area comparisons.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"racquel.fygenson@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Racquel Fygenson"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lace M.

For all environments, we measured the number of visualizations recalled and their order (2D) or spatial location (3D, VR, MR). We also measured the number of syntactic and semantic features recalled. Results of our study show increased recall and greater richness of data understanding in the MR condition. Not only did participants recall more visualizations and ordinal/spatial positions in MR, but they also remembered more details about graph axes and data mappings, and more information about the shape of the data. We discuss how differences in the spatial and kinesthetic cues provided in these different environments could contribute to these results, and reasons why we did not observe comparable performance in the 3D and VR conditions.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Christophe Hurter"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bernice Rogowitz"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guillaume Truong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tiffany Andry"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hugo Romat"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ludovic Gardy"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fereshteh Amini"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nathalie Henry Riche"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233336588/v-tvcg-20233336588_Preview.mp4?token=NXF49TRW3Iw2249Btsx68oteEXEikPfeZHc82cpwHnA&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Christophe Hurter"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3336588","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"In this study, inspired by the memory palace technique, we explore how different presentation technologies impact the recall of data, specifically using Isotypes.

However, there is a need to address their potential constraints, especially in the context of human cognitive capacity limits. These limits dictate the maximum information our mind can process at once. We explore the issue of capacity limitation by testing competing theories that describe how the number of frames shown in a display, the scale of the frames, and time constraints impact user performance with small multiples of line charts in an energy grid scenario. In two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 141 and Experiment 2 n = 360) and a follow-up eye-tracking analysis (n=5),we found a linear decline in accuracy with increasing frames across seven tasks, which was not fully explained by differences in frame size, suggesting visual search challenges. Moreover, the studies demonstrate that highlighting specific frames can mitigate some visual search difficulties but, surprisingly, not eliminate them. This research offers insights into optimizing the utility of small multiples by aligning them with human limitations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Helia Hosseinpour"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Laura E.

The identification and visualization of clusters in graphs enable insight discovery in many application areas, such as life sciences and social sciences. Force-directed graph layouts promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they bring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. At the same time, matrices can effectively show clusters when a suitable row/column ordering is applied, but are less appealing to untrained users not providing an intuitive node-link metaphor. It is thus worth exploring layouts combining the strengths of the node-link metaphor and node ordering. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and `sfdp'.

However, common analytics tasks are multifaceted, encompassing interactions among four key aspects: strength, function, structure, and content. Current node-link visualization designs may fall short, focusing narrowly on certain aspects and neglecting the holistic, dynamic nature of egocentric networks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpreadLine, a novel visualization framework designed to enable the visual exploration of egocentric networks from these four aspects at the microscopic level. Leveraging the intuitive appeal of storyline visualizations, SpreadLine adopts a storyline-based design to represent entities and their evolving relationships. We further encode essential topological information in the layout and condense the contextual information in a metro map metaphor, allowing for a more engaging and effective way to explore temporal and attribute-based information. To guide our work, with a thorough review of pertinent literature, we have distilled a task taxonomy that addresses the analytical needs specific to egocentric network exploration.Acknowledging the diverse analytical requirements of users, SpreadLine offers customizable encodings to enable users to tailor the framework for their tasks.

Well-known representations like node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices offer valuable insights, but their effectiveness relies on the ability to identify patterns in the underlying topological structure. Reordering strategies and layout algorithms play a vital role in the visualization process since the arrangement of nodes, edges, or cells influences the visibility of these patterns. The BioFabric visualization combines elements of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, leveraging the strengths of both, the visual clarity of node-link diagrams and the tabular organization of adjacency matrices.A unique characteristic of BioFabric is the possibility to reorder nodes and edges separately.This raises the question of which combination of layout algorithms best reveals certain patterns. In this paper, we discuss patterns and anti-patterns in BioFabric, such as staircases or escalators, relate them to already established patterns, and propose metrics to evaluate their quality. Based on these quality metrics, we compared combinations of well-established reordering techniques applied to BioFabric with a well-known benchmark data set. Our experiments indicate that the edge order has a stronger influence on revealing patterns than the node layout. The results show that the best combination for revealing staircases is a barycentric node layout, together with an edge order based on node indices and length.Our research contributes a first building block for many promising future research directions, which we also share and discuss.

They are commonly used to display temporal data or hierarchical graphs. Previous research has demonstrated that minimizing edge crossings is the most important criterion to consider when looking to improve the readability of such graphs. While heuristic approaches exist for crossing minimization, we are interested in optimal approaches to the problem that prioritize human readability over computational scalability. We aim to improve the usefulness and applicability of such optimal methods by understanding and improving their scalability to larger graphs. This paper categorizes and evaluates the state-of-the-art linear programming formulations for exact crossing minimization and describes nine new and existing techniques that could plausibly accelerate the optimization algorithm. Through a computational evaluation, we explore each technique's effect on calculation time and how the techniques assist or inhibit one another, allowing researchers and practitioners to adapt them to the characteristics of their graphs. Our best-performing techniques yielded a median improvement of 2.5\u201317x depending on the solver used, giving us the capability to create optimal layouts faster and for larger graphs.

As more techniques are developed and published, a clear need for evaluation and experimental comparisons between them emerges. Most studies explore the temporal dimension and diverse interaction techniques supporting the participants, focusing on a single structural representation. Empirical evidence about performance and preference for different visualization approaches is scattered over different studies, experimental settings, and tasks. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the dynamic network visualization design space in two evaluations. First, a controlled study assessing participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of network structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without the support of standard interaction methods. Second, the best-performing combinations from the first study are enhanced based on participants' feedback and evaluated in a heuristic-based qualitative study with visualization experts on a real-world network. Our results highlight node-link with animation and playback controls as the best-performing combination and the most preferred based on ratings. Matrices achieve similar performance to node-link in the first study but have considerably lower scores in our second evaluation. Similarly, juxtaposition exhibits evident scalability issues in more realistic analysis contexts.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Velitchko Filipov"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alessio Arleo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Markus B\u00f6gl"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Silvia Miksch"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233310019/v-tvcg-20233310019_Preview.mp4?token=02r77JEMELRLQ63amQMGJlcBzC5lAQwyWngc-6ZJD6Y&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233310019/v-tvcg-20233310019_Preview.srt?token=pFAzbhYPtALNNUdKtVzOnFtRyLq7V2pk4xP5fjJgUCc&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Velitchko Filipov"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3310019","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This study evaluates the effectiveness of various network structural and temporal encodings in dynamic network visualization, focusing on Node-Link diagrams and Adjacency Matrices.

However, selecting an appropriate time window (i.e., slicing a dynamic network into snapshots) is challenging and time-consuming, often involving a trial-and-error approach to investigating underlying structural patterns. To address this challenge, we present MoNetExplorer, a novel interactive visual analytics system that leverages temporal network motifs to provide recommendations for window sizes and support users in visually comparing different slicing results. MoNetExplorer provides a comprehensive analysis based on window size, including (1) a temporal overview to identify the structural information, (2) temporal network motif composition, and (3) node-link-diagram-based details to enable users to identify and understand structural patterns at various temporal resolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted a case study with network researchers using two real-world dynamic network datasets. Our case studies show that the system effectively supports users to gain valuable insights into the temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Seokweon Jung"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"DongHwa Shin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kiroong Choe"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233337396/v-tvcg-20233337396_Preview.mp4?token=0KbM6aJwuxs0G0Rpw-vPJ-2xQQAfINseTMtQMJ2zaJg&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233337396/v-tvcg-20233337396_Preview.srt?token=TOU6HuziX7iYDRKMcEVe6c9fvmCcyt7m6ExjtTavEJs&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Seokweon Jung"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3337396","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"MoNetExplorer is a visual analytics system designed to support the selection of appropriate window sizes for dynamic network analysis and provides a temporal and structural analysis of snapshots that are sliced according to window sizes.

In our work, we address this question by evaluating the GPT-4 multimodal LLM using a suite of task sets meant to assess the model's visualization literacy.

Our assessment finds that GPT-4 can perform tasks such as recognizing trends and extreme values, and also demonstrates some understanding of visualization design best-practices. By contrast, GPT-4 struggles with simple value retrieval when not provided with the original dataset, lacks the ability to reliably distinguish between colors in charts, and occasionally suffers from hallucination and inconsistency.

Misleading charts can distort the viewer\u2019s perception of data, leading to misinterpretations and decisions based on false information. The development of effective automatic detection methods for misleading charts is an urgent field of research. The recent advancement of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising direction for addressing this challenge. We explored the capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the impact of different prompting strategies on the models\u2019 analyses. We utilized a dataset of misleading charts collected from the internet by prior research and crafted nine distinct prompts, ranging from simple to complex, to test the ability of four different multimodal LLMs in detecting over 21 different chart issues. Through three experiments\u2013from initial exploration to detailed analysis\u2013we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs to identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the scalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the initial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and critical thinking in data interpretation. There is significant potential in employing multimodal LLMs to counter misleading information by supporting critical thinking and enhancing visualization literacy.

For example, researchers of visualization literacy require large, diverse banks of items to conduct studies where the same skill is measured repeatedly on the same participants. Yet, generating a large number of high-quality, diverse items requires significant time and expertise. To address the critical need for a large number of diverse visualization items in education and research, this paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of multiple-choice visualization items. Through an iterative design process, we develop the VILA (Visualization Items Generated by Large LAnguage Models) pipeline, for efficiently generating visualization items that measure people\u2019s ability to accomplish visualization tasks. We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is the VILA bank of \u223c1,100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of the VILA pipeline, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people\u2019s ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; comparing it to the existing VLAT, VILA-VLAT shows moderate to high convergent validity (R = 0.70). Lastly, we discuss the application areas of the VILA pipeline and the VILA bank and provide practical recommendations for their use.

We asked students to verbally walk through their process of making sense of unfamiliar visualizations, and conducted a qualitative analysis of these walkthroughs. Our qualitative analysis found that after taking a visualization course, students engaged with visualizations in more sophisticated ways: they were more likely to exhibit design empathy by thinking critically about the tradeoffs behind why a chart was designed in a particular way, and were better able to deconstruct a chart to make sense of it. We also gave students a quantitative assessment of visualization literacy and found no evidence of scores improving after the class, likely because the test we used focused on a different set of skills than those emphasized in visualization classes. While current measurement instruments for visualization literacy are useful, we propose developing standardized assessments for additional aspects of visualization literacy, such as deconstruction and design empathy.

Our study with 26 participants revealed that the in-situ support effectively assisted users in interpreting charts and enhanced learning by addressing specific chart-related questions and encouraging further exploration. Visual communication allowed participants to convey their interests straightforwardly, eliminating the need for textual descriptions. However, the LLM assistance led users to engage less with the system, resulting in fewer insights from the visualizations. This suggests that users, particularly those with lower data literacy and motivation, may have over-relied on the LLM agent. We discuss opportunities for deploying LLMs to enhance visualization literacy while emphasizing the need for a balanced approach.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kiroong Choe"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chaerin Lee"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiwon Song"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aeri Cho"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nam Wook Kim"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243413195/v-tvcg-20243413195_Preview.mp4?token=VRK1LBdTylEoAdQv7uQncr9J8VSmYIY9CjKfByD6vto&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243413195/v-tvcg-20243413195_Preview.srt?token=EeqHuoJJEOM3CmdAysIVV8s6o8tsaqPqAnOTVWdOZus&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Kiroong Choe"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3413195","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Our system allows users to interact with charts using both text and visual inputs.

This paper investigates the integration of written language into the visualization design process. We create the idea of a 'writing rudder,' which acts as a guiding force or strategy for the designer. Via an interview study of 24 working visualization designers, we first established that only a minority of participants systematically use writingto aid in design. A second study with 15 visualization designers examined four different variants of written rudders: asking questions, stating conclusions, composing a narrative, and writing titles. Overall, participants had a positive reaction; designers recognized the benefits of explicitly writing down components of the design and indicated that they would use this approach in future design work.More specifically, two approaches - writing questions and writing conclusions/takeaways - were seen as beneficial across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise mainly for the creation stage. Although concerns around potential bias during data exploration were raised, participants also discussed strategies to mitigate such concerns. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between language and visualization, and proposes a straightforward, lightweight addition to the visualization design process.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"chase_stokes@berkeley.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliations":["Self, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"clarahu@berkeley.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Clara Hu"},{"affiliations":["UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"hearst@berkeley.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marti Hearst"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1140/v-full-1140_Preview.mp4?token=Oa5acEgF9yK70H6UaYyGjVl90iRXE9dQ_dGCjqjQ3x0&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1140/v-full-1140_Preview.srt?token=m7laA4Mo72JmMkAMFTbu76ZbzbeERu_2BtU6v4TUddU&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Chase Stokes"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Main findings from two interview studies.

A variety of interactive techniques have been proposed for authoring data visualizations, such as template editing, shelf configuration, natural language input, and code editors. However, it remains unclear how genomics experts create visualizations and which techniques best support their visualization tasks and needs. To address this gap, we conducted two user studies with genomics researchers: (1) semi-structured interviews (n=20) to identify the tasks, user contexts, and current visualization authoring techniques and (2) an exploratory study (n=13) using visual probes to elicit users\u2019 intents and desired techniques when creating visualizations. Our contributions include (1) a characterization of how visualization authoring is currently utilized in genomics visualization, identifying limitations and benefits in light of common criteria for authoring tools, and (2) generalizable design implications for genomics visualization authoring tools based on our findings on task- and user-specific usefulness of authoring techniques.

Thematic maps pose a number of unique challenges for responsiveness, such as inflexible aspect ratios that do not easily adapt to varying screen dimensions, or densely clustered visual elements in urban areas becoming illegible at smaller scales. However, design guidance on how to best address these issues is currently lacking. We conducted design sessions with eight professional designers and developers of web-based thematic maps for information visualization. Participants were asked to redesign a given map for various screen sizes and aspect ratios and to describe their reasoning for when and how they adapted the design. We report general observations of practitioners\u2019 motivations, decision-making processes, and personal design frameworks. We then derive seven challenges commonly encountered in responsive maps, and 17 strategies to address them, such as repositioning elements, segmenting the map, or using alternative visualizations. We compile these challenges and strategies into an illustrated cheat sheet targeted at anyone designing or learning to design responsive maps.

While the effects of examples have been studied in other disciplines, such as web design or engineering, the results are not readily applicable to visualization due to inconsistencies in findings and challenges unique to visualization design. Towards bridging this gap, we conduct an exploratory experiment involving 32 data visualization designers focusing on the influence of five factors (timing, quantity, diversity, data topic similarity, and data schema similarity) on objectively measurable design outcomes (e.g., numbers of designs and idea transfers). Our quantitative analysis shows that when examples are introduced after initial brainstorming, designers curate examples with topics less similar to the dataset they are working on and produce more designs with a high variation in visualization components. Also, designers copy more ideas from examples with higher data schema similarities. Our qualitative analysis of participants\u2019 thought processes provides insights into why designers incorporate examples into their designs, revealing potential factors that have not been previously investigated. Finally, we discuss how our results inform how designers may use examples during design ideation as well as future research on quantifying designs and supporting example-based visualization design.

Subsequently, we specify objects, visual marks, properties, and appearance, storing them in a gene. Lastly, we map data onto the flowpath, ensuring suitable morphisms. Alternative designs are created by exchanging values in the gene. For example, designs that share similar traits, are created by making small incremental changes to the gene. Our design methodology fosters the generation of diverse creative concepts, space-filling visualisations, and traditional formats like bar charts, circular plots and pie charts. Through our implementation we showcase the model in action. As an example application, we integrate the output visualisations onto a smartwatch and visualisation dashboards.

Participants reported mind wandering while viewing visualizations from a pre-labeled visualization database and then provided quantitative ratings of trust, engagement, and design quality, along with qualitative descriptions and short-term/long-term recall assessments. Results show that mind wandering negatively affects short-term visualization recall and various post-viewing measures, particularly for visualizations with little text annotation. Further, the type of mind wandering impacts engagement and emotional response. Mind wandering also functions as an intermediate process linking visualization design elements topost-viewing measures, influencing how viewers engage with and interpret visual information over time.

Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields. The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions. Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks. In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions. Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software. We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution. First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods. Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support.

Given an input scalar field f and a set of \u201csignal\u201d persistence pairs to maintain, our approaches produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of \u201cnon-signal\u201d pairs, while (ii) preserving the \u201csignal\u201d pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification approaches, our method is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our work enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our framework can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing.

One alternative is to represent the vector field using a discrete approach, which constructs a collection of pairs of simplices in the input mesh that satisfies criteria introduced by Forman\u2019s discrete Morse theory. While numerous approaches exist to compute pairs in the restricted case of the gradient of a scalar field, state-of-the-art algorithms for the general case of vector fields require expensive optimization procedures. This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every simplex in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features. Empirical results on analytic and simulation data demonstrate drastic improvements in running time, produce features similar to the current state-of-the-art, and show the application of simplification to large, complex flows","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"finkent@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tanner Finken"},{"affiliations":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France"],"email":"julien.tierny@sorbonne-universite.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Julien Tierny"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"josh@cs.arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Joshua A Levine"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1494/v-full-1494_Preview.mp4?token=usx194xYVR8-djPko3ohF_0PYny_K5RbH2x0Fqx0ZFw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Tanner Finken"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We extract and simplify a vector field of ocean currents using our technique.

A commonly agreed upon vortex definition remained elusive since a proper vortex core needs to satisfy two hard constraints: it must be objective and Lagrangian. Recent methods on objectivization met the first but not the second constraint, since there was no formal guarantee that the resulting vortex coreline is indeed a pathline of the fluid flow. In this paper, we propose the first vortex core definition that is both objective and Lagrangian. Our approach restricts observer motions to follow along pathlines, which reduces the degrees of freedoms: we only need to optimize for an observer rotation that makes the observed flow as steady as possible. This optimization succeeds along Lagrangian vortex corelines and will result in a non-zero time-partial everywhere else. By performing this optimization at each point of a spatial grid, we obtain a residual scalar field, which we call vortex deviation error. The local minima on the grid serve as seed points for a gradient descent optimization that delivers sub-voxel accurate corelines. The visualization of both 2D and 3D vortex cores is based on the separation of the movement of the vortex core and the swirling flow behavior around it. While the vortex core is represented by a pathline, the swirling motion around it is visualized by streamlines in the correct frame. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several 2D and 3D time-dependent vector fields.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliations":["University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"],"email":"theisel@ovgu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Holger Theisel"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1574/v-full-1574_Preview.mp4?token=1dzHZmqY0ScY43iHcq0r_TadN7TuEBg0fKQ4q1NmftE&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1574/v-full-1574_Preview.srt?token=fVx8Bc3PS0li54gRmGAIQ0fnF-lBMxgiFhzZIe4XS2M&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Tobias G\u00fcnther"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"In this paper, we present the first finite-time approach that extracts objective vortex corelines, which are guaranteed to be pathlines of the underlying flow.

Uncovering ensemble patterns and analyzing individual members is a challenging task that suffers from clutter. Ensemble statistical summarization can alleviate this issue by permitting analyzing ensembles' distributional components like the mean and median, confidence intervals, and outliers. Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular non-parametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas F.

This cyclical way of working creates challenges within the linear structure of computational notebooks, leading to issues with code quality, recall, and reproducibility. To remedy this, we present Loops, a set of visual support techniques for iterative and exploratory data analysis in computational notebooks. Loops leverages provenance information to visualize the impact of changes made within a notebook. In visualizations of the notebook provenance, we trace the evolution of the notebook over time and highlight differences between versions. Loops visualizes the provenance of code, markdown, tables, visualizations, and images and their respective differences. Analysts can explore these differences in detail in a separate view. Loops not only makes the analysis process transparent but also supports analysts in their data science work by showing the effects of changes and facilitating comparison of multiple versions.

However, existing research on script understanding primarily focuses on revealing the process of data transformations, lacking the ability to analyze the potential scope, i.e., the space of script inputs and outputs. Meanwhile, constructing input/output space during script analysis is challenging, as the wrangling scripts could be semantically complex and diverse, and the association between different data objects is intricate. To facilitate data workers in understanding the input and output space of wrangling scripts, we summarize ten types of constraints to express table space and build a mapping between data transformations and these constraints to guide the construction of the input/output for individual transformations. Then, we propose a constraint generation model for integrating table constraints across multiple transformations. Based on the model, we develop Ferry, an interactive system that extracts and visualizes the data constraints describing the input and output space of data wrangling scripts, thereby enabling users to grasp the high-level semantics of complex scripts and locate the origins of faulty data transformations. Besides, Ferry provides example input and output data to assist users in interpreting the extracted constraints and checking and resolving the conflicts between these constraints and any uploaded dataset. Ferry\u2019s effectiveness and usability are evaluated through two usage scenarios and two case studies, including understanding, debugging, and checking both single and multiple scripts, with and without executable data.

Many of these tools have been designed through collaborations with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. However, the design, implementation, and practical use of these tools still rely on siloed approaches, resulting in bespoke applications that are difficult to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these tools undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts, typically treating them only as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, they lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, they tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers to cross-domain collaboration. To address these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine data preprocessing, management, and visualization stages while tracking the provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse set of usage scenarios targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access. These scenarios use different types of data and domain methodologies to illustrate Curio's flexibility in tackling pressing societal challenges.

We then design a notebook-embedded interactive visualization and validate it with intended users. In a follow-up study, we present participants with multiple graphical and scripting interaction modes to elicit feedback about notebook-embedded visualization design, finding consensus in support of the interaction model.

Given a graphic input and original label information, how to place labels to meet both geometric and aesthetic requirements is an open challenging problem. Geometry-wise, traditional rule-driven solutions struggle to capture the complex interactions between labels, let alone consider graphical/appearance content. In terms of aesthetics, training/evaluation data ideally require nontrivial effort and expertise in design, thus resulting in a lack of decent datasets for learning-based methods. To address the above challenges, we formulate the task with a graph representation, where nodes correspond to labels and edges to interactions between labels, and treat label placement as a node position prediction problem. With this novel representation, we design a Label Placement Graph Transformer (LPGT) to predict label positions. Specifically, edge-level attention, conditioned on node representations, is introduced to reveal potential relationships between labels. To integrate graphic/image information, we design a feature aligning strategy that extracts deep features for nodes and edges efficiently. Next, to address the dataset issue, we collect commercial illustrations with professionally designed label layouts from household appliance manuals, and annotate them with useful information to create a novel dataset named the Appliance Manual Illustration Labels (AMIL) dataset. In the thorough evaluation on AMIL, our LPGT solution achieves promising label placement performance compared with popular baselines.

While data visualizations are widely discussed in online communities and social media, comments tend to be displayed separately from the visualization and we lack ways to relate these discussions back to the content of the visualization, e.g., to situate comments, explain visual patterns, or question assumptions. In our visualization annotation interface, users can designate areas within the visualization. Discursive patinas are made of overlaid visual marks (anchors), attached to textual comments with category labels, likes, and replies. By coloring and styling the anchors, a meta visualization emerges, showing what and where people comment and annotate the visualization. These patinas show regions of heavy discussions, recent commenting activity, and the distribution of questions, suggestions, or personal stories. We ran workshops with 90 students, domain experts, and visualization researchers to study how people use anchors to discuss visualizations and how patinas influence people's understanding of the discussion. Our results show that discursive patinas improve the ability to navigate discussions and guide people to comments that help understand, contextualize, or scrutinize the visualization. We discuss the potential of anchors and patinas to support discursive engagements, including critical readings of visualizations, design feedback, and feminist approaches to data visualization.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"tobias.kauer@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias Kauer"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"derya.akbaba@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Derya Akbaba"},{"affiliations":["University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"doerk@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marian D\u00f6rk"},{"affiliations":["Inria, Bordeaux, France","University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"bbach@inf.ed.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Benjamin Bach"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1394/v-full-1394_Preview.mp4?token=CBABLCrD8Q-YwP3M7gFn4tKU58vJoBc0VguQ7DYvcRM&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1394/v-full-1394_Preview.srt?token=Aie2P6umyj0_cHVPgHwnqva_Uf-UOJIhrGytP-lXn_o&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Tobias Kauer"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Discursive Patinas present a new technique that visualizes discussions about visualizations, inspired by traces left in the physical world","keywords":["Data Visualization, Discussion, Annotation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"No","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17994","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full31","slot_id":"v-full-1394","time_end":"2024-10-17T14:27:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T14:15:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T14:15:00Z","title":"Discursive Patinas: Anchoring Discussions in Data Visualizations","uid":"v-full-1394","youtube_ff_id":"zBwtliqYULc","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/zBwtliqYULc","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLsXwoR_H8E?start=48"},{"abstract":"Sketching is a common practice among visualization designers, and an approachable entry to visualizations for individuals, but moving from a sketch to a full fledged data visualization often requires throwing away the original sketch recreating it from scratch.

Automatic reweighting methods identify problematic samples with label quality issues by recognizing their negative effects on validation samples and assigning lower weights to them. However, these methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance when the validation samples are of low quality. To tackle this, we develop Reweighter, a visual analysis tool for sample reweighting. The reweighting relationships between validation samples and training samples are modeled as a bipartite graph. Based on this graph, a validation sample improvement method is developed to improve the quality of validation samples. Since the automatic improvement may not always be perfect, a co-cluster-based bipartite graph visualization is developed to illustrate the reweighting relationships and support the interactive adjustments to validation samples and reweighting results. The adjustments are converted into the constraints of the validation sample improvement method to further improve validation samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Reweighter in improving reweighting results through quantitative evaluation and two case studies.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yukai Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jing Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zheng Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lan-Zhe Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yu-Feng Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233345340/v-tvcg-20233345340_Preview.mp4?token=VcRo6hbin8uXz7KmnTsmVvNa8mU_S8VAGYC-BJIeQhc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233345340/v-tvcg-20233345340_Preview.srt?token=xjZQ2cID1hWuPw7zn9Kzqgwk49mOw6WoCKYnM3tYuPY&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Weikai Yang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3345340","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Reweightor: (a) The reweighting relationships between 3 (out of 14) validation sample clusters and 6 (out of 35) training sample clusters.

However, due to point sparsity, lack of structure, irregular distribution, and acquisition-related inaccuracies, results of point cloudvisualization are often subject to visual complexity and ambiguity. In this regard, non-photorealistic rendering can improve visual communication by reducing the cognitive effort required to understand an image or scene and by directing attention to important features. In the last 20 years, this has been demonstrated by various non-photorealistic rrendering approaches that were proposed to target point clouds specifically. However, they do not use a common language or structure for assessment which complicates comparison and selection. Further, recent developments regarding point cloud characteristics and processing, such as massive data size or web-based rendering are rarelyconsidered. To address these issues, we present a survey on non-photorealistic rendering approaches for point cloud visualization, providing an overview of the current state of research. We derive a structure for the assessment of approaches, proposing seven primary dimensions for the categorization regarding intended goals, data requirements, used techniques, and mode of operation. We then systematically assess corresponding approaches and utilize this classification to identify trends and research gaps, motivating future research in the development of effective non-photorealistic point cloud rendering methods.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ole Wegen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Willy Scheibel"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthias Trapp"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Rico Richter"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"J\u00fcrgen D\u00f6llner"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243402610/v-tvcg-20243402610_Preview.mp4?token=tXNQN9yjdAbyE28srWhHmmcERkq0tv8cnRvStp7S6fo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243402610/v-tvcg-20243402610_Preview.srt?token=H6gSriwCgV9HBrta1RH3a67XaSIrXcm7yFaM3WxEoaM&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Ole Wegen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3402610","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) can improve visual communication by reducing the cognitive effort required to understand an image and by directing attention to important features.

Such an assistant must be able to perceive the environment and actions, reason about the environment state in relation to a given task, and seamlessly interact with the task performer. These interactions typically involve an AR headset equipped with sensors which capture video, audio, and haptic feedback. Previous works have sought to facilitate the development of intelligent AR assistants by visualizing these sensor data streams in conjunction with the assistant's perception and reasoning model outputs. However, existing visual analytics systems do not focus on user modeling or include biometric data, and are only capable of visualizing a single task session for a single performer at a time. Moreover, they typically assume a task involves linear progression from one step to the next. We propose a visual analytics system that allows users to compare performance during multiple task sessions, focusing on non-linear tasks where different step sequences can lead to success. In particular, we design visualizations for understanding user behavior through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data as a proxy for perception, attention, and memory as well as corresponding motion data (acceleration, angular velocity, and gaze). We distill these insights into embedding representations that allow users to easily select groups of sessions with similar behaviors. We provide two case studies that demonstrate how to use these visualizations to gain insights abouttask performance using data collected during helicopter copilot training tasks. Finally, we evaluate our approach by conducting an in-depth examination of a think-aloud experiment with five domain experts.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"s.castelo@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sonia Castelo Quispe"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"jlrulff@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jo\u00e3o Rulff"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"pss442@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Parikshit Solunke"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"erin.mcgowan@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Erin McGowan"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York CIty, United States"],"email":"guandewu@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guande Wu"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"iran@ccrma.stanford.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Iran Roman"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"rlopez@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Roque Lopez"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"bs3639@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bea Steers"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"qisun@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qi Sun"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"jpbello@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Juan Pablo Bello"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Redondo Beach, United States"],"email":"bradley.feest@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bradley S Feest"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman, Aurora, United States"],"email":"michael.middleton@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Middleton"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman, Falls Church, United States"],"email":"ryan.mckendrick@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ryan McKendrick"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"csilva@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Claudio Silva"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1833/v-full-1833_Preview.mp4?token=kXpVEp2G8JSoWr3JmAkTz5HHLuEVtLEGtn6CkLaAN8k&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1833/v-full-1833_Preview.srt?token=TJChJ8-kK0-qBRk7QY9CzGYXXCNAFxVIEHdA94znYnw&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Sonia Castelo Quispe"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"HuBar is a visual analytics system designed to analyze performer behavior in AR-assisted tasks, enabling multi-perspective analysis of multimodal time-series data.

Progressive visualization (PV) and visual analytics (PVA) alleviate this problem by allowing immediate feedback and interaction with large datasets and complex computations, avoiding waiting for complete results by using partial results improving with time. Yet, creating a progressive visualization requires more effort than a regular visualization but also opens up new possibilities, such as steering the computations towards more relevant parts of the data, thus saving computational resources. However, there is currently no comprehensive overview of the design space for progressive visualization systems. We surveyed the related work of PV and derived a new taxonomy for progressive visualizations by systematically categorizing all PV publications that included visualizations with progressive features. Progressive visualizations can be categorized by well-known visualization taxonomies, but we also found that progressive visualizations can be distinguished by the way they manage their data processing, data domain, and visual update.

While several recent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory environments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored, mono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a versatile approach (supporting both triangulated domains and regular grids) for the support of topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct numbers of processes. While developing this extension, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. We describe an MPI extension of TTK\u2019s data structure for triangulation representation and traversal, a central component to the global performance and generality of TTK\u2019s topological implementations. We also introduce an intermediate interface between TTK and MPI, both at the global pipeline level, and at the fine-grain algorithmic level. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from 20% to 80% (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1536 cores). Finally, we provide a roadmap for the completion of TTK\u2019s MPI extension, along with generic recommendations for each algorithm communication category.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"E.

Nonetheless, creating accurately labeled medical texts of high quality is often a time-consuming task that requires specialized domain knowledge. Traditional methods for generating labeled data typically rely on rigid rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to new tasks. While recent machine learning (ML) methodologies have mitigated the manual labeling efforts, configuring models to align with specific research requirements can be challenging for labelers without technical expertise. Moreover, automated labeling techniques, such as transfer learning, face difficulties in in directly incorporating expert input, whereas semi-automated methods, like data programming, allow knowledge integration through rules or knowledge bases but may lack continuous result refinement throughout the entire labeling process. In this study, we present a collaborative human-ML teaming workflow that seamlessly integrates visual cluster analysis and active learning to assist domain experts in labeling medical text with high efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an innovative neural network model called the embedding network, which incorporates expert insights to generate task-specific embeddings for medical texts. We integrate the workflow and embedding network into a visual analytics tool named KMTLabeler, equipped with coordinated multi-level views and interactions. Two illustrative case studies, along with a controlled user study, provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of KMTLabeler in creating an efficient labeling environment for medical text classification.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"He Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Ouyang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuchen Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chang Jiang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lixia Jin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuanwu Cao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Quan Li"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243406387/v-tvcg-20243406387_Preview.mp4?token=VnPRkdepeRVTnH4pmVCk7zBKKkpq42d2mzlaLMT86as&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243406387/v-tvcg-20243406387_Preview.srt?token=MPFzXxvpYtQoeH-IVkROFZyv0TberWC63x-c_lzzevI&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Quan Li"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3406387","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":" The KMTLabeler interface: The (A) Control Panel provides an overview of the dataset and enables filtering for labeling.

Today's lossy compressors rarely consider preserving topologies such as Morse-Smale complexes, and the discrepancies in topology between original and decompressed datasets could potentially result in erroneous interpretations or even incorrect scientific conclusions. In this paper, we focus on preserving Morse-Smale segmentations in 2D/3D piecewise linear scalar fields, targeting the precise reconstruction of minimum/maximum labels induced by the integral line of each vertex. The key is to derive a series of edits during compression time. These edits are applied to the decompressed data, leading to an accurate reconstruction of segmentations while keeping the error within the prescribed error bound. To this end, we develop a workflow to fix extrema and integral lines alternatively until convergence within finite iterations. We accelerate each workflow component with shared-memory/GPU parallelism to make the performance practical for coupling with compressors. We demonstrate use cases with fluid dynamics, ocean, and cosmology application datasets with a significant acceleration with an NVIDIA A100 GPU.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"li.14025@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuxiao Li"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Riverside, Riverside, United States"],"email":"xlian007@ucr.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xin Liang"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bei Wang"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"qiu.722@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yongfeng Qiu"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"lyan@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lin Yan"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1793/v-full-1793_Preview.mp4?token=mq_GwqVoaX8VM0EBDuKWSvU8zRZEYMCZpPRYlndDs5E&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1793/v-full-1793_Preview.srt?token=qZnV8L0OVhtE5M8C6zYi7I6Me-QIz-UonlBkWLAHe44&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yuxiao Li"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This figure compares SZ3 and ours (SZ3) in terms of feature preservation capability for MSS in combustion data.

In this paper, we propose a new framework to facilitate the comparative analysis of merge trees, inspired by tools from locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH hashes similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability. We propose two new similarity measures for merge trees that can be computed via LSH, using new extensions to Recursive MinHash and subpath signature, respectively. Our similarity measures are extremely efficient to compute and closely resemble the results of existing measures such as merge tree edit distance or geometric interleaving distance.

Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed \u201clayering\u201d. Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., \u03bb2), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"adeelz92@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adeel Zafar"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"zpoorsha@cougarnet.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zahra Poorshayegh"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"diyang@uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Di Yang"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"chengu@cs.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoning Chen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1188/v-short-1188_Preview.mp4?token=sgv_irFDfgo2UYspqvHcN4nevlgpkBM3_ckeCMVGAiU&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1188/v-short-1188_Preview.srt?token=SYeVB_zKh2OueId1Sa6sV8jHchqiMdi7Sb3LdtGw9Yk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Adeel Zafar"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This figure illustrates the steps of the proposed topological separation method.

In contrast to traditional auto-encoders which operate on vectorized data, our formulation explicitly manipulates merge trees on their associated metric space at each layer of the network, resulting in superior accuracy and interpretability. Our novel neural network approach can be interpreted as a non-linear generalization of previous linear attempts [79] at merge tree encoding. It also trivially extends to persistence diagrams. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms, with MT-WAE computations in the orders of minutes on average. We show the utility of our contributions in two applications adapted from previous work on merge tree encoding [79]. First, we apply MT-WAE to merge tree compression, by concisely representing them with their coordinates in the final layer of our auto-encoder. Second, we document an application to dimensionality reduction, by exploiting the latent space of our auto-encoder, for the visual analysis of ensemble data. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by introducing two penalty terms, to help preserve in the latent space both the Wasserstein distances between merge trees, as well as their clusters. In both applications, quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used for reproducibility.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mathieu Pont"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Julien Tierny"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233334755/v-tvcg-20233334755_Preview.mp4?token=NCOxCxgJ-2fZg33e5WgixMfQD43MuXdvBkAm4BXwzrI&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233334755/v-tvcg-20233334755_Preview.srt?token=SGT5s_ZQcXHR43diaNIsh61J_pojn88sDLy60lEsaso&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Julien Tierny"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3334755","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Visual analysis of the Earthquake ensemble ((a) each ground-truth class is represented by one of its members), with our Wasserstein Auto-Encoder of Merge Trees (MT-WAE).

Numerous studies contribute to visualizing information spread, but few have considered the implicit and complex diffusion patterns among multiple platforms. To bridge the gap, we summarize cross-platform diffusion patterns with experts and identify significant factors that dissect the mechanisms of cross-platform information spread. Based on that, we propose an information diffusion model that estimates the likelihood of a topic/post spreading among different social media platforms. Moreover, we propose a novel visual metaphor that encapsulates cross-platform propagation in a manner analogous to the spread of seeds across gardens. Specifically, we visualize platforms, posts, implicit cross-platform routes, and salient instances as elements of a virtual ecosystem \u2014 gardens, flowers, winds, and seeds, respectively. We further develop a visual analytic system, namely BloomWind, that enables users to quickly identify the cross-platform diffusion patterns and investigate the relevant social media posts.

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can improve processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy. These findings help inform real-world best practices for building dynamic displays.

In practice, when viewers are confronted with embedded visualizations, they often have to focus on a primary task and can only quickly glance at a visualization showing rich, often dynamically updated, information. As such, the visualizations must be designed so as not to distract from the primary task, while at the same time being readable and useful for aiding the primary task. For example, in games, players who are engaged in a battle have to look at their enemies but also read the remaining health of their own game character from the health bar over their character's head. Many trade-offs are possible in the design of embedded visualizations in such dynamic scenarios, which we explore in-depth in this paper with a focus on user experience. We use video games as an example of an application context with a rich existing set of visualizations in motion. We begin our work with a systematic review of in-game visualizations in motion. Next, we conduct an empirical user study to investigate how different embedded visualizations in motion designs impact user experience. We conclude with a set of considerations and trade-offs for designing visualizations in motion more broadly as derived from what we learned about video games.

However, when analysts try different tuning parameter settings, the amount of latent components complicates analytical tasks. Based on our years-long collaboration with SBSS researchers, we propose a visualization approach to tackle this challenge. The main component is UnDRground Tubes (UT), a general-purpose idiom combining ideas from set visualization and multidimensional projections. We describe the UT visualization pipeline and integrate UT into an interactive multiple-view system. We demonstrate its effectiveness through interviews with SBSS experts, a qualitative evaluation with visualization experts, and computational experiments. SBSS experts were excited about our approach. They saw many benefits for their work and potential applications for geostatistical data analysis more generally. UT was also well received by visualization experts.

Multi-dimensional partitionings occur, for example, when analyzing parameter spaces of simulation models, where each segment of the partitioning represents a region of similar model behavior. Having computed a partitioning, one is commonly interested in understanding how large the segments are and which segments lie next to each other. While visual representations of 2D domain partitionings that reveal sizes and neighborhoods are straightforward, this is no longer the case when considering multi-dimensional domains of three or more dimensions. We propose an algorithm for computing 2D embeddings of multi-dimensional partitionings. The embedding shall have the following properties: It shall maintain the topology of the partitioning and optimize the area sizes and joint boundary lengths of the embedded segments to match the respective sizes and lengths in the multi-dimensional domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to different use cases, including the visual exploration of 3D spatial domain segmentations and multi-dimensional parameter space partitionings of simulation ensembles. We numerically evaluate our algorithm with respect to how well sizes and lengths are preserved depending on the dimensionality of the domain and the number of segments.

Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE, address this challenge by projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important relationships. TopoMap is another technique that excels at preserving the underlying structure of the data, leading to interpretable visualizations. In particular, TopoMap maps the high-dimensional data into a visual space, guaranteeing that the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the visual space matches the one from the high-dimensional data. However, the original TopoMap algorithm can be slow and its layout can be too sparse for large and complex datasets. In this paper, we propose three improvements to TopoMap: 1) a more space-efficient layout, 2) a significantly faster implementation, and 3) a novel TreeMap-based representation that makes use of the topological hierarchy to aid the exploration of the projections.These advancements make TopoMap, now referred to as TopoMap++, a more powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional data which we demonstrate through different use case scenarios.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"vitoriaguardieiro@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Vitoria Guardieiro"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"felipedeoliveira1407@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Felipe Inagaki de Oliveira"},{"affiliations":["Microsoft Research India, Bangalore, India"],"email":"harish.doraiswamy@microsoft.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Harish Doraiswamy"},{"affiliations":["University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, Brazil"],"email":"gnonato@icmc.usp.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"csilva@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Claudio Silva"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1632/v-full-1632_Preview.mp4?token=NL73IBsAgaCsJAwcWrdzocAOZp8ABJQsqvlxLuVM_aE&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1632/v-full-1632_Preview.srt?token=nnuxA1POcFJtGJo3RfG9Z26Htjb_KbUYaTm9HT9mwH0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Vitoria Guardieiro"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Representations of the MNIST database of handwritten digits.

Hyperbolic spaces have proven to be an important tool for embedding computations and analysis tasks as their non-linear nature lends itself well to tree or graph data. Subsequently, they have also been used in the visualization of high-dimensional data, where they exhibit increased embedding performance. However, none of the existing dimensionality reduction methods for embedding into hyperbolic spaces scale well with the size of the input data. That is because the embeddings are computed via iterative optimization schemes and the computation cost of every iteration is quadratic in the size of the input. Furthermore, due to the non-linear nature of hyperbolic spaces, Euclidean acceleration structures cannot directly be translated to the hyperbolic setting. This paper introduces the first acceleration structure for hyperbolic embeddings, building upon a polar quadtree. We compare our approach with existing methods and demonstrate that it computes embeddings of similar quality in significantly less time.

Existing methods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the same category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we introduce SimpleSets, which uses simple shapes to enclose categorical point patterns, thereby providing a clean overview of the data distribution. SimpleSets is designed to visualize sets of points with a single categorical attribute; as a result, the point patterns enclosed by SimpleSets form a partition of the data. We give formal definitions of point patterns that correspond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions categorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a rendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of shapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm pays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a consistent manner.

This proliferation has underscored the importance of expediting the deployment of charging infrastructure. Both academia and industry have thus devoted to addressing the charging station location problem (CSLP) to streamline this process. However, prevailing algorithms addressing CSLP are hampered by restrictive assumptions and computational overhead, leading to a dearth of comprehensive evaluations in the spatiotemporal dimensions. Consequently, their practical viability is restricted. Moreover, the placement of charging stations exerts a significant impact on both the road network and the power grid, which necessitates the evaluation of the potential post-deployment impacts on these interconnected networks holistically. In this study, we propose CSLens, a visual analytics system designed to inform charging station deployment decisions through the lens of coupled transportation and power networks. CSLens offers multiple visualizations and interactive features, empowering users to delve into the existing charging station layout, explore alternative deployment solutions, and assess the ensuring impact. To validate the efficacy of CSLens, we conducted two case studies and engaged in interviews with domain experts. Through these efforts, we substantiated the usability and practical utility of CSLens in enhancing the decision-making process surrounding charging station deployment.

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model\u2019s decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens, a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model\u2019s features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study. These collective efforts underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of MARLens in enhancing our understanding of MARL-based TSC systems and pave the way for more informed and efficient traffic management strategies.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yutian Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guohong Zheng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhiyuan Liu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quan Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haipeng Zeng"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243392587/v-tvcg-20243392587_Preview.mp4?token=y-4GRT4qfjHVR1kac6qvxMnL7ooqMxs-3oOePS5YQJs&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yutian Zhang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3392587","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"MARLens provides an in-depth analysis of reinforcement-learning-based traffic signal control.

Comparing multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but traditional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework for comparing embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts\u2014confusion, neighborhood, and relative size\u2014to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships. Informed by a preliminary user study, we implemented our framework using perceptual neighborhood graphs to define these regions and introduced metrics to quantify each concept.We demonstrate the generality of our framework with usage scenarios from machine learning and single-cell biology, highlighting our metrics' ability to draw insightful comparisons across label hierarchies. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an evaluation study with five machine learning researchers and six single-cell biologists using an interactive and scalable prototype built with Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets. Case studies reveal that ModalChorus can facilitate intuitive discovery of misalignment and efficient re-alignment in scenarios ranging from zero-shot classification to cross-modal retrieval and generation.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yilin Ye"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"sxiao713@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shishi Xiao"},{"affiliations":["the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"xingchen.zeng@outlook.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xingchen Zeng"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"email":"weizeng@hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wei Zeng"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1603/v-full-1603_Preview.mp4?token=U2SeRph0CmCty6EkL1awqGasK-mUH3IZYpTsKqatksE&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yilin Ye"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"ModalChorus supports multi-modal embeddings visualization with Modal Fusion Map and interactive alignment.","keywords":["Multi-modal embeddings, dimensionality reduction, data fusion, interactive alignment"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, PCS","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12315","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full9","slot_id":"v-full-1603","time_end":"2024-10-17T13:06:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T12:54:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T12:54:00Z","title":"ModalChorus: Visual Probing and Alignment of Multi-modal Embeddings via Modal Fusion Map","uid":"v-full-1603","youtube_ff_id":"oJrEG0FkEYw","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/oJrEG0FkEYw","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H85FqQyR25U?start=1701"},{"abstract":"The semantic similarity between documents of a text corpus can be visualized using map-like metaphors based on two-dimensional scatterplot layouts. These layouts result from a dimensionality reduction on the document-term matrix or a representation within a latent embedding, including topic models. Thereby, the resulting layout depends on the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction and is therefore affected by changes in them. Furthermore, the resulting layout is affected by changes in the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction. However, such changes to the layout require additional cognitive efforts from the user. In this work, we present a sensitivity study that analyzes the stability of these layouts concerning (1) changes in the text corpora, (2) changes in the hyperparameter, and (3) randomness in the initialization. Our approach has two stages: data measurement and data analysis. First, we derived layouts for the combination of three text corpora and six text embeddings and a grid-search-inspired hyperparameter selection of the dimensionality reductions. Afterward, we quantified the similarity of the layouts through ten metrics, concerning local and global structures and class separation. Second, we analyzed the resulting 42817 tabular data points in a descriptive statistical analysis. From this, we derived guidelines for informed decisions on the layout algorithm and highlight specific hyperparameter settings.

Unfortunately, classical scatterplots suffer from scalability issues, since growing data sizes eventually lead to overplotting and visual clutter on a screen with a fixed resolution, which hinders the data analysis process. We propose an algorithm that compensates for irregular sample distributions by a smooth transformation of the scatterplot's visual domain. Our algorithm evaluates the scatterplot's density distribution to compute a regularization mapping based on integral images of the rasterized density function. The mapping preserves the samples' neighborhood relations. Few regularization iterations suffice to achieve a nearly uniform sample distribution that efficiently uses the available screen space. We further propose approaches to visually convey the transformation that was applied to the scatterplot and compare them in a user study. We present a novel parallel algorithm for fast GPU-based integral-image computation, which allows for integrating our de-cluttering approach into interactive visual data analysis systems.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hennes Rave"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vladimir Molchanov"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lars Linsen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243381453/v-tvcg-20243381453_Preview.mp4?token=NVVkX__ZVN0UirCznvSvnrnTguAsZpcIu8o5MqWIO6Q&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Hennes Rave"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3381453","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"UMAP embedding of the MNIST dataset with color-coded classes after four iterations of our algorithm (top left), with grid lines (top right), with density background texture (bottom left), and with contour lines (bottom right).

Complex traffic patterns are difficult to predict and manage and impose cognitive load on the air traffic controllers. In this work we present an interactive visual analytics interface which facilitates detection and resolution of complex traffic patterns for air traffic controllers. The interface supports air traffic controllers in detecting complex clusters of aircraft and further enables them to visualize and simultaneously compare how different re-routing strategies for each individual aircraft yield reduction of complexity in the entire sector for the next hour. The development of the concepts was supported by the domain-specific feedback we received from six fully licensed and operational air traffic controllers in an iterative design process over a period of 14 months.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden","Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"elmira.zohrevandi@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Elmira Zohrevandi"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden","Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"katerina.vrotsou@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Katerina Vrotsou"},{"affiliations":["Institute of Science and Technology, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden","Institute of Science and Technology, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"carl.westin@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Carl A.

Prior research has identified five dimensions of trust assessment in visualizations (credibility, clarity, reliability, familiarity, and confidence), and observed that these dimensions tend to vary predictably along with certain features of the visualization being evaluated. This raises a further question: how do the design features driving viewers' trust assessment vary with the characteristics of the viewers themselves? By reanalyzing data from these studies through the lens of individual differences, we build a more detailed map of the relationships between design features, individual characteristics, and trust behaviors. In particular, we model the distinct contributions of endogenous design features (such as visualization type, or the use of color) and exogenous user characteristics (such as visualization literacy), as well as the interactions between them. We then use these findings to make recommendations for individualized and adaptive visualization design.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Smith College, Northampton, United States"],"email":"jcrouser@smith.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"R.

However, the gap between common programmatic analysis (e.g., within computational notebooks) and exploratory visual analysis leads to a disjointed and inefficient data analysis experience. To bridge this gap, we developed PyGWalker, a Python library that offers on-the-fly assistance for exploratory visual data analysis.

While these insights are valuable for data exploration and chart interpretation, users currently only have a binary choice of accepting or rejecting them, lacking the flexibility to refine the system logic or customize the insight generation process. To address this limitation, we present Groot, a prototype system that allows users to proactively specify and refine automated data insights. The system allows users to directly manipulate chart elements to receive insight recommendations based on their selections. Additionally, Groot provides users with a manual editing interface to customize, reconfigure, or add new insights to individual charts and propagate them to future explorations. We describe a usage scenario to illustrate how these features collectively support insight editing and configuration and discuss opportunities for future work, including incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs), improving semantic data and visualization search, and supporting insight management.

Much of the difficulty arises from maintaining visualization state across many animated graphical elements that may change in number over time. We contribute Counterpoint, a framework for state management designed to help implement such visualizations in JavaScript. Using Counterpoint, developers can manipulate large collections of marks with reactive attributes that are easy to render in scalable APIs such as Canvas and WebGL.

Users can easily misuse analysis methods, potentially decreasing the validity of results. To address this problem, we introduce GuidedStats, an interactive interface within computational notebooks that encapsulates guidance, models, visualization, and exportable results into interactive workflows. It breaks down typical analysis processes, such as linear regression and two-sample T-tests, into interactive steps supplemented with automatic visualizations and explanations for step-wise evaluation. Users can iterate on input choices to refine their models, while recommended actions and exports allow the user to continue their analysis in code.

Many of their colleagues rely on data but are not themselves analysts; furthermore, their colleagues are reluctant or unable to use dedicated analytical applications or dashboards, and they expect communication to take place within threaded collaboration platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. In this paper, we introduce a set of six strategies for adapting content from business intelligence (BI) dashboards into appropriate formats for sharing on collaboration platforms, formats that we refer to as dashboard snapshots. Informed by prior studies of enterprise communication around data, these strategies go beyond redesigning or restyling by considering varying levels of data literacy across an organization, introducing affordances for self-service question-answering, and anticipating the post-sharing lifecycle of data artifacts. These strategies involve the use of templates that are matched to common communicative intents, serving to reduce the workload of data professionals. We contribute a formal representation of these strategies and demonstrate their applicability in a comprehensive enterprise communication scenario featuring multiple stakeholders that unfolds over the span of months.

While these approaches provide flexibility, they create a significant barrier to entry for non-experts and obscure the immediate impact of architectural decisions on model performance. In response to this challenge, recent no-code approaches have been developed with the aim of enabling easy model development through graphical interfaces. However, both traditional and no-code methodologies share a common limitation that the inability to predict model outcomes or identify issues without executing the model. To address this limitation, we introduce an intuitive visual feedback-based no-code approach to visualize and analyze deep learning models during the design phase. This approach utilizes dataflow-based visual programming with dynamic visual encoding of model architecture. A user study was conducted with deep learning developers to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the model design process, improving model understanding, and facilitating a more intuitive development experience. The findings of this study suggest that real-time architectural visualization significantly contributes to more efficient model development and a deeper understanding of model behaviors.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"juny0603@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"JunYoung Choi"},{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"wings159@vience.co.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sohee Park"},{"affiliations":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"hellenkoh@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"GaYeon Koh"},{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"k0seo0330@vience.co.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Youngseo Kim"},{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"wkjeong@korea.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Won-Ki Jeong"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1047/v-short-1047_Preview.mp4?token=CMcl7ui0rQ393UyFOML-kB2MqUGiK4UTVazthQ6Lrtw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1047/v-short-1047_Preview.srt?token=i2_eLL9wzYoVKRhFXnyAoQv3qoo_n0tZ5v9c3rqE-zk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["JunYoung Choi"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"An example of proofreading of structural issues in a deep learning model (U-Net) using a proposed visual feedback-based no-code approach, and an example of the conventional method (code-based) corresponding to the errors present in the model.","keywords":["Deep learning, visual programming, explainable AI."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://vience.io/vience-canvas/mlops/sample","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, both PCS and external","paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"short3","slot_id":"v-short-1047","time_end":"2024-10-17T18:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T18:21:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T18:21:00Z","title":"Intuitive Design of Deep Learning Models through Visual Feedback","uid":"v-short-1047","youtube_ff_id":"79um-yl_rvU","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/79um-yl_rvU","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L9rtmx-1eyM?start=2395"},{"abstract":"Semantic interaction (SI) in Dimension Reduction (DR) of images allows users to incorporate feedback through direct manipulation of the 2D positions of images.

We propose ImageSI, an SI method for image DR that incorporates user feedback directly into the image model to update the underlying embeddings, rather than weighting them. In doing so, ImageSI ensures that the embeddings suitably capture the features necessary for the task so that the DR can subsequently organize images using those features. We present two variations of ImageSI using different loss functions - ImageSI_MDS\u22121 , which prioritizes the explicit pairwise relationships from the interaction and ImageSI_Triplet, which prioritizes clustering, using the interaction to define groups of images.

Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 models can detect misleading visualizations with moderate accuracy without prior training (naive zero-shot) and that performance considerably improves by providing the model with the definitions of misleaders (guided zero-shot). Our results indicate that a single prompt engineering technique does not necessarily yield the best results for all types of misleaders.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a text-based image format common in data visualizations, matches well with the text sequence processing of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we explore the capability of LLMs to perform 10 low-level visual analytic tasks defined by Amar, Eagan, and Stasko directly on SVG-based visualizations. Using zero-shot prompts, we instruct the models to provide responses or modify the SVG code based on given visualizations. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively modify existing SVG visualizations for some tasks like Cluster but perform poorly on tasks requiring mathematical operations like Compute Derived Value. We also discovered that LLM performance can vary based on factors such as the number of data points, the presence of value labels, and the chart type.

Traditional approaches often require detailed knowledge of a graph querying language, limiting the ability for users - even experts - to acquire valuable insights from KGs. LinkQ simplifies this process by implementing a multistep protocol in which the LLM interprets a user's question, then systematically converts it into a well-formed query. LinkQ helps users iteratively refine any open-ended questions into precise ones, supporting both targeted and exploratory analysis.

Our idea is to introduce clones of data points, \u201cghosts\u201d, into UMAP\u2019s layout optimization process. Ghosts are designed to be completely passive: they do not affect any others but are influenced by attractive and repulsive forces from the original data points. After a single optimization run, GhostUMAP can capture the projection instability of data points by measuring the variance with the projected positions of their ghosts. We also present a successive halving technique to reduce the computation of GhostUMAP.

We contribute an optional extension to the model and grammar that allows for hierarchical coordination. Through three use cases, we show that use-coordination enables implementation of CMV in systems containing not only basic statistical charts but also more complex visualizations such as medical imaging volumes.

In several applications, including biological workflows, chemical equations, and computational data flow analysis, these graphs often exhibit a tree-like nesting structure, where sibling clusters are disjoint. Common compound graph layouts prioritize the lowest level of the grouping, down to the individual ungrouped vertices, which can make the higher level grouped structures more difficult to discern, especially in deeply nested networks. Leveraging the additional structure of the tree-like nesting, we contribute an overview+detail layout for this class of compound graphs that preserves the saliency of the higher level network structure when groups are expanded to show internal nested structure. Our layout draws inner structures adjacent to their parents, using a modified tree layout to place substructures. We describe our algorithm and then present case studies demonstrating the layout's utility to a domain expert working on data flow analysis.

We collected data from 18 researchers using an interface that we designed using network simplification methods and analyzed how users browsed and identified important papers.

These fronts are a widely used conceptual model in meteorology, which are often encountered in the literature as two-dimensional (2D) front lines on surface analysis charts. This paper presents a method for computing three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric fronts as surfaces that is capable of extracting continuous and well-confined features suitable for 3D visual analysis, spatio- temporal tracking, and statistical analyses (Fig. 1, middle, right). Recently developed contour-based methods for 3D front extraction rely on computing the third derivative of a moist potential temperature field. Additionally, they require the field to be smoothed to obtain continuous large-scale structures. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative method to front extraction using ridge surface computation. The proposed method requires only the second derivative of the input field and produces accurate structures even from unsmoothed data. An application of the ridge-based method to a data set corresponding to Cyclone Friederike demonstrates its benefits and utility towards visual analysis of the full 3D structure of fronts.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"anne.gossing@fu-berlin.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anne Gossing"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christoph.fischer-1@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christoph Fischer"},{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"klenert@zib.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas Klenert"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"email":"vijayn@iisc.ac.in","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vijay Natarajan"},{"affiliations":["Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"george.pacey@fu-berlin.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"George Pacey"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"thorwin.vogt@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Thorwin Vogt"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"marc.rautenhaus@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marc Rautenhaus"},{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"baum@zib.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Baum"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1183/v-short-1183_Preview.mp4?token=07DX41XUOHJ0wsi8xtxI1j34lYN1AbYb3Uz6Cb4WH70&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Anne Gossing"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Atmospheric fronts play a significant role in mid-latitude weather dynamics and are responsible for 50% - and locally up to 90% - of extreme precipitation.

However, creating effective transfer functions that align with users' visual objectives is often challenging due to the complex parameter space and the semantic gap between transfer function values and features of interest within the volume. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in language-vision models to bridge this semantic gap. By employing a fully differentiable rendering pipeline and an image-based loss function guided by language descriptions, our method generates transfer functions that yield volume-rendered images closely matching the user's intent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in creating meaningful transfer functions from simple descriptions, empowering users to intuitively express their desired visual outcomes with minimal effort.

However, it remains challenging to assess how these models process charts. Existing benchmarks only roughly evaluate model performance without evaluating the underlying mechanisms, such as how models extract image embeddings. This limits our understanding of the model's ability to perceive fundamental graphical components. To address this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework to assess the graphical perception of image embedding models. For chart comprehension, we examine two main aspects of channel effectiveness: accuracy and discriminability of various visual channels. Channel accuracy is assessed through the linearity of embeddings, measuring how well the perceived magnitude aligns with the size of the stimulus. Discriminability is evaluated based on the distances between embeddings, indicating their distinctness. Our experiments with the CLIP model show that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and shows unique discriminability in channels like length, tilt, and curvature. We aim to develop this work into a broader benchmark for reliable visual encoders, enhancing models for precise chart comprehension and human-like perception in future applications.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"dtngus0111@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jangsus1@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Minsuk Chang"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"shpark@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Seokhyeon Park"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1072/v-short-1072_Preview.mp4?token=oWDGK7OGFYWlhpETPpd7Cs6OTMqdpsTMLkMzxcdeBcE&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Soohyun Lee"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"An image showing how differently the image embedding model perceives changes in different visual channels.

When the ratio is less than 50\\%, participants begin to be influenced by the sine illusion. This effect can be significantly exacerbated when the difference between the two deltas falls under 30\\%.We compared two explanations for the sine illusion based on our data: either participants were mistakenly using the perpendicular distance between the two lines to make their comparison (the perpendicular explanation), or they incorrectly relied on the length of the line segment perpendicular to the angle bisector of the bottom and top lines (the equal triangle explanation).

While prior research has explored this ability in conventional charts, it is unclear if spatial visualizations used by computational scientists afford a similar ensemble perception capacity. We investigate people's ability to estimate two summary statistics, mean and variance, from pseudocolor scalar fields. In a crowdsourced experiment, we find that participants can reliably characterize both statistics, although variance discrimination requires a much stronger signal. Multi-hue and diverging colormaps outperformed monochromatic, luminance ramps in aiding this extraction. Analysis of qualitative responses suggests that participants often estimate the distribution of hotspots and valleys as visual proxies for data statistics. These findings suggest that people's summary interpretation of spatial datasets is likely driven by the appearance of discrete color segments, rather than assessments of overall luminance. Implicit color segmentation in quantitative displays could thus prove more useful than previously assumed by facilitating quick, gist-level judgments about color-coded visualizations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"vmateevitsi@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor A.

In a crowdsourced study with 134 participants (69 below age 60, 66 aged 60 and above), we assessed their accuracy and time performing analysis tasks across three common visualization types (Bar, Line, Scatterplot) and two contrast polarities (positive and negative). We observed that, across both age groups, the polarity that led to better performance and the resulting amount of improvement varied on an individual basis, with each polarity benefiting comparable proportions of participants. However, the contrast polarity that led to better performance did not always match their preferred polarity. Additionally, we observed that the choice of contrast polarity can have an impact on time similar to that of the choice of visualization type, resulting in an average percent difference of around 36%.

This paper investigates the design patterns of visualizations with RTL scripts. We collected 128 visualizations from data-driven articles published in Arabic news outlets and analyzed their chart composition, textual elements, and sources. Our analysis suggests that designers tend to apply RTL approaches more frequently for categorical data. In other situations, we observed a mix of Left-to-right (LTR) and RTL approaches for chart directions and structures, sometimes inconsistently utilized within the same article.

Typically, reconstruction algorithms first identify common features across images and then minimize reconstruction errors after estimating the shape of the terrain. This bundle adjustment (BA) step optimizes around a single, simplifying scalar value that obfuscates many possible causes of reconstruction errors (e.g., initial estimate of the position and orientation of the camera, lighting conditions, ease of feature detection in the terrain). Reconstruction errors can lead to inaccurate scientific inferences or endanger a spacecraft exploring a remote environment. To address this challenge, we present VECTOR, a visual analysis tool that improves error inspection for stereo reconstruction BA. VECTOR provides analysts with previously unavailable visibility into feature locations, camera pose, and computed 3D points.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an avenue to address these challenges, but their ability to extract the relevant semantic information remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four publicly available LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, Llama3, and Mixtral), investigating their ability to comprehend utterances even in the presence of uncertainty and identify the relevant data context and visual tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs are sensitive to uncertainties in utterances. Despite this sensitivity, they are able to extract the relevant data context.

We thus investigate a resource overlooked by current ML-based approaches: the declarative documents describing how charts should visually encode data (i.e., chart specifications). In this work, we use chart specifications to enhance language models (LMs) for chart-reading tasks, such that the resulting system can robustly understand language for CQA. Through a case study with 359 bar charts, we test novel fine tuning schemes on both GPT-3 and T5 using a new dataset curated for two CQA tasks: question-answering and visual explanation generation. Our text-only approaches strongly outperform vision-based GPT-4 on explanation generation (99% vs. 63% accuracy), and show promising results for question-answering (57-67% accuracy). Through in-depth experiments, we also show that our text-only approaches are mostly robust to natural language variation.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, San Jose, United States"],"email":"victorbursztyn2022@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor S.

In our preliminary exploratory study, we investigate whether this approach could effectively facilitate the introduction of new visualization types to blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. Specifically, we present two approaches, direct and gradual, to a user who is blind and compare their potential usefulness. The direct approach involved a single, comprehensive description of the visual elements, while the gradual approach utilized a series of visualizations and transitions, starting from familiar visualization types known to the user and progressing to the final, novel visualization. We introduce two genomics visualizations, sequence logos and Circos plots, to the user with descriptions and then ask them to sketch the visualizations to reflect their understanding of the visual elements. Feedback from the user indicates that the gradual approach was easier to follow, suggesting that BLV individuals could benefit more from this method. We outline our design process and insights from the study, and highlight key considerations for future research directions.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"tsmits@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Thomas C.

These displays are often multi-purpose, functioning as interfaces for selecting device settings, communicating operating status using simple visualizations, and displaying notifications. However, their usability for people in the late adulthood (PLA) development stage is not well-understood. We report on two focus groups with PLA (n=11, ages 76-94) from a local retirement community. Participants were shown images of everyday home electronics and appliances, answering questions about their experiences using the EIDs. Using open coding, we qualitatively analyzed their comments to distill key themes regarding how EIDs can negatively affect PLA's ability to take in information (e.g., poor labels) and interact with these devices (e.g., unintuitive steps) alongside strategies employed to work around these issues. We argue that understanding the equitable design and communication of devices' functions, operating status, and messages is important for future information display designers.

The most widely used remedy for making data visualizations accessible is text descriptions. Yet, manually creating useful text descriptions is often omitted by visualization authors, either because of a lack of awareness or a perceived burden. Automatically generated text descriptions are a potential partial remedy. However, with current methods it is unfeasible to create text descriptions for complex scientific charts. In this paper, we describe our methods for generating text descriptions for one complex scientific visualization: the UpSet plot. UpSet is a widely used technique for the visualization and analysis of sets and their intersections. At the same time, UpSet is arguably unfamiliar to novices and used mostly in scientific contexts. Generating text descriptions for UpSet plots is challenging because the patterns observed in UpSet plots have not been studied. We first analyze patterns present in dozens of published UpSet plots. We then introduce software that generates text descriptions for UpSet plots based on the patterns present in the chart. Finally, we introduce a web service that generates text descriptions based on a specification of an UpSet plot, and demonstrate its use in both an interactive web-based implementation and a static Python implementation of UpSet.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"ishratjahan.eliza@utah.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ishrat Jahan Eliza"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"jakew@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jake Wagoner"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"jwilburn@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jack Wilburn"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"natelanzadevelopment@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nate Lanza"},{"affiliations":["University College London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"d.hajas@ucl.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Hajas"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"alex@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alexander Lex"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Ishrat Jahan Eliza"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop7","slot_id":"w-accessible-1015","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"Accessible Text Descriptions for UpSet Plots","uid":"w-accessible-1015","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"Many data visualization tools require a mouse.

Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure the projection\u2019s accuracy or faithfulness to the full data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and other distance-based quality metrics analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make normalized stress scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a small benchmark.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"ksmelser@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kiran Smelser"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"jacobmiller1@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jacob Miller"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"stephen.kobourov@tum.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stephen Kobourov"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-beliv/w-beliv-1008/w-beliv-1008_Preview.mp4?token=Um2oJjnT2y3HO9IljRJKeSSUa93W3n11qrkN3dI3dAs&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-beliv/w-beliv-1008/w-beliv-1008_Preview.srt?token=okgeJ3fLQmb9x7DcRRyrZCL_4cYRm7_qRC2KHtcoOXY&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Jacob Miller"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"MDS, t-SNE, and RND (random) embeddings of the well-known Iris dataset from left to right (bottom).

However, the effectiveness of a visualisation may be intrinsically related to, and difficult to distinguish from, factors such as visualisation literacy. Complicating matters further, visualisation literacy itself is not a singular intrinsic quality, but can be a result of several distinct challenges that a viewer encounters when performing a task with a visualisation. In this paper, we describe how such challenges apply to experiments that we use to evaluate visualisations, and discuss a set of considerations for designing studies in the future. Finally, we argue that aspects of the study design which are often neglected or overlooked (such as the onboarding of participants, tutorials, training etc.) can have a big role in the results of a study and can potentially impact the conclusions that the researchers can draw from the study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"abhraneel@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Abhraneel Sarma"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"shenglong@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sheng Long"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Portland, United States"],"email":"m.correll@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Correll"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Chicago, United States"],"email":"matthew.kay@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthew Kay"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Abhraneel Sarma"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The 'Telephone' framework describes two possible pathways of participants\u2019 behaviour in experiments.

In policymaking, personal narratives are regarded as an important source of intelligence to shape public discourse andpolicy. Therefore, policymakers are interested in the interplay between individual-level experiences and macro-political processes that play into shaping these experiences. In this context, visualisation is regarded as a medium for advocacy, creating a power balance between individuals and the power structures that influence their health and well-being. In this paper, we offer a politically-framed reflection on how visualisation creators define lived experience data, and what design choices they make for visualising them. We identify data characteristics and design choices that enable visualisation authors and consumers to engage in a process of narrative co-construction, while navigating structural forms of inequality. Our political framing is driven by ideas of master and alternative narratives from Diversity Science, in which authors and narrators engage in a process of negotiation with power structures to either maintain or challenge the status quo.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"mai.elshehaly@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Mai Elshehaly"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"mirela.reljan-delaney@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mirela Reljan-Delaney"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"j.dykes@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jason Dykes"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"j.d.wood@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jo Wood"},{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"sam.spiegel@ed.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sam Spiegel"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Mai Elshehaly"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The Master Narrative Framework for Visualization, which may be useful for exposing Master narratives, developing Alternative narratives and establishing Personal narratives in visualization design, critique and education.

We conducted a preliminary pilot study with ten individuals with varied expertise from rangingNLP, ML, and ethics, to specific domains. All individuals were actively using or working with AI/ML technology as part of their daily jobs. Through semi-structured interviews grounded in a set of concrete examples, we examined how CFEs influence participants' perceptions of the model's correctness, fairness, and trustworthiness, and how visualization of CFEs specifically influences those perceptions. We also surface how participants wrestle with their internal definitions of `explainability', relative to what CFEs present, their cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to the, much more widely studied phenomena, of comparing their baseline expectations of the model's performance. Compared to prior research, our findings highlight the sociotechnical frictions that CFEs surface but do not necessarily remedy.

The evaluation of visualization systems is fundamental to ensuring their effectiveness, usability, and impact. Faithful evaluations provide valuable insights into how users interact with and perceive the system, enabling designers to make informed decisions about design choices and improvements. However, an emerging trend of multiple evaluations within a single study raises critical questions about the sustainability, feasibility, and methodological rigor of such an approach. So, how many evaluations are enough? is a situational question and cannot be formulaically determined. Our objective is to summarize current trends and patterns to understand general practices across different contribution and evaluation types. New researchers and students, influenced by this trend, may believe-- multiple evaluations are necessary for a study. However, the number of evaluations in a study should depend on its contributions and merits, not on the trend of including multiple evaluations to strengthen a paper. In this position paper, we identify this trend through a non-exhaustive literature survey of TVCG papers from issue 1 in 2023 and 2024. We then discuss various evaluation strategy patterns in the information visualization field and how this paper will open avenues for further discussion.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"flin@unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Feng Lin"},{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"dilshadur@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Md Dilshadur Rahman"},{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Danielle Albers Szafir"},{"affiliations":["University of Oklahoma, Norman, United States"],"email":"quadri@ou.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Arran Zeyu Wang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"(Left) Distribution of four evaluation methods (quantitative, qualitative, case study, and mixed methods) across 214 papers, showing whether each type was not utilized, used once, or used multiple times within single study.

We conducted interviews with experts from different domains performing the Mini-VLAT test for visualization literacy to identify potential problems. Our participants reported that the time limit per question, ambiguities in the questions and visualizations, and missing steps in the test procedure mainly had an impact on their performance and content. We discuss possible changes to the test design to address these issues and how such assessment methods could be integrated into existing evaluation procedures.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"seyda.oeney@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Seyda \u00d6ney"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"moataz.abdelaal@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Moataz Abdelaal"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"kuno.kurzhals@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kuno Kurzhals"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"paul.betz@sowi.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Paul Betz"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"cordula.kropp@sowi.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Cordula Kropp"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Weiskopf"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Seyda \u00d6ney"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Domain experts may be asked to take the Mini-VLAT test to assess their visualization skills.

While existing models like the Information Visualization Reference Model describe the data-to-visual mapping process, they often overlook a crucial intermediary step: design-specific transformations. This process, occurring after data transformation but before visual-data mapping, further derives data, such as groupings, layout, and statistics, that are essential to properly render the visualization. In this paper, we advocate for a deeper exploration of design-specific transformations, highlighting their importance in understanding visualization properties, particularly in relation to user tasks. We incorporate design-specific transformations into the Information Visualization Reference Model and propose a new formalism that encompasses the user task as a function over data. The resulting formalism offers three key benefits over existing visualization models: (1) describing tasks as compositions of functions, (2) enabling analysis of data transformations for visual-data mapping, and (3) empowering reasoning about visualization correctness and effectiveness. We further discuss the potential implications of this model on visualization theory and visualization experiment design.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Columbia University, New York City, United States"],"email":"ewu@cs.columbia.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"eugene Wu"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"remco@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["eugene Wu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We propose to extend the Infovis Reference Model to explicitly model the role of design-specific data transformations in visualization design.

This survey examines the intersection of organizational studies and visualization design, highlighting the concept of \\textit{boundary objects}, which visualization practitioners are adopting in both CSCW (computer-supported collaborative work) and HCI. This paper also collects the prior literature on boundary objects in visualization design studies, a methodology which maps closely to action research in organizations, and addresses the same problems of `knowing in common'. Process artifacts generated by visualization design studies function as boundary objects in their own right, facilitating knowledge transfer across disciplines within an organization. Currently, visualization faces the challenge of explaining how sense-making functions across domains, through visualization artifacts, and how these support decision-making. As a deeply interdisciplinary field, visualization should adopt the theory of boundary objects in order to embrace its plurality of domains and systems, whilst empowering its practitioners with a unified process-based theory.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["UC Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, United States"],"email":"jtotto@ucsc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jasmine Tan Otto"},{"affiliations":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"sd@scottdavidoff.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Scott Davidoff"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Jasmine Otto"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"A `transit network' map of knowledge transfer in complex organizations.

The success of these models stems from their ability to mimic human capabilities, namely visual perception in vision models, and analytical reasoning in large language models. As visual perception and analysis are fundamental to data visualization, in this position paper we ask: how can we harness foundation models to advance progress in visualization design? Specifically, how can multimodal foundation models (MFMs) guide visualization design through visual perception? We approach these questions by investigating the effectiveness of MFMs for perceiving visualization, and formalizing the overall visualization design and optimization space. Specifically, we think that MFMs can best be viewed as judges, equipped with the ability to criticize visualizations, and provide us with actions on how to improve a visualization. We provide a deeper characterization for text-to-image generative models, and multi-modal large language models, organized by what these models provide as output, and how to utilize the output for guiding design decisions. We hope that our perspective can inspire researchers in visualization on how to approach MFMs for visualization design.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Vanderbilt University, Nashville, United States"],"email":"matthew.berger@vanderbilt.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Matthew Berger"},{"affiliations":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , Livermore, United States"],"email":"shusenl@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shusen Liu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Matthew Berger"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We characterize the use of multimodal foundation models for guiding visualization design.","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"associated6b","slot_id":"w-beliv-1027","time_end":"2024-10-14T19:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-14T16:00:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-14T16:00:00Z","title":"[position paper] The Visualization JUDGE : Can Multimodal Foundation Models Guide Visualization Design Through Visual Perception?","uid":"w-beliv-1027","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iXPK-CWIysQ?start=881"},{"abstract":"Submissions of original research that use Large Language Models (LLMs) or that study their behavior, suddenly account for a sizable portion of works submitted and accepted to visualization (VIS) conferences and similar venues in human-computer interaction (HCI).In this brief position paper, I argue that reviewers are relatively unprepared to evaluate these submissions effectively.

It is important to equip university students with these essential data skills. To learn, design, and develop data visualization, students need knowledge of programming and data science topics. Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey's results, we identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets. We also distilled five opportunities for developing a successful data science and visualization course. These opportunities include clarifying the course structure, emphasizing visualization literacy early in the course, updating the course content according to student needs, using large real-world datasets, learning from industry professionals, and promoting collaboration among students.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"shrihariniramesh@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shri Harini Ramesh"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada","Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"fateme.rajabiyazdi@carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fateme Rajabiyazdi"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Shri Harini Ramesh"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05969","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop3a","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1008","time_end":"2024-10-13T13:45:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T13:10:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T13:10:00Z","title":"Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science","uid":"w-eduvis-1008","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CGfeWajdPXw?start=2842"},{"abstract":"Academic advising can positively impact struggling students' success. We developed AdVizor, a data-driven learning analytics tool for academic risk prediction for advisors. Our system is equipped with a random forest model for grade prediction probabilities uses a visualization dashboard to allows advisors to interpret model predictions. We evaluated our system in mock advising sessions with academic advisors and undergraduate students at our university. Results show that the system can easily integrate into the existing advising workflow, and visualizations of model outputs can be learned through short training sessions. AdVizor supports and complements the existing expertise of the advisor while helping to facilitate advisor-student discussion and analysis. Advisors found the system assisted them in guiding student course selection for the upcoming semester. It allowed them to guide students to prioritize the most critical and impactful courses. Both advisors and students perceived the system positively and were interested in using the system in the future. Our results encourage the development of intelligent advising systems in higher education, catered for advisors.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, Canada"],"email":"riley.weagant@ontariotechu.net","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Riley Weagant"},{"affiliations":["Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, Canada"],"email":"zixin.zhao@ontariotechu.net","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Zixin Zhao"},{"affiliations":["Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, Canada"],"email":"abradley@uncharted.software","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Adam Badley"},{"affiliations":["Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, Canada"],"email":"christopher.collins@ontariotechu.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christopher Collins"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-eduvis/w-eduvis-1013/w-eduvis-1013_Preview.mp4?token=MEibWd4aMD5VjMhdpUG36Mlq-IT4gyQHec2_Pzkw40I&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-eduvis/w-eduvis-1013/w-eduvis-1013_Preview.srt?token=QZwYkdAHRWd5UxGYaX72aY20X_jhmYmrtp3uAB2V54w&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Zixin Zhao"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Figure of a student and academic advisor sitting across from each other with a computer screen between them, on top is a zoomed out image of the AdVizor interface.","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop3a","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1013","time_end":"2024-10-13T13:45:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T13:10:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T13:10:00Z","title":"AdVizor: Using Visual Explanations to Guide Data-Driven Student Advising","uid":"w-eduvis-1013","youtube_ff_id":"0srC2ClVQTY","youtube_ff_link":"https://youtu.be/0srC2ClVQTY","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XeytaUH5Z8c?start=1719"},{"abstract":"In this paper, we discuss our experiences advancing a professional-oriented graduate program in Cartography & GIScience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to account for fundamental shifts in conceptual framings, rapidly evolving mapping technologies, and diverse student needs.

While visualization has become integral to various areas, including education, our own ongoing collaboration has induced reflections and discussions we believe could benefit visualization research. In particular, we identify five key perspectives: surpassing traditional evaluation metrics by incorporating established educational measures; defining constructs based on existing learning and educational research frameworks; applying established cognitive theories to understand interpretation and interaction with visualizations; establishing uniform terminology across disciplines; and, fostering interdisciplinary convergence. We argue that by integrating educational research constructs, methodologies, and theories, visualization research can further pursue ecological validity and thereby improve the design and evaluation of visual tools. Our essay emphasizes the potential of intensified and systematic collaborations between educational scientists and visualization researchers to advance both fields, and in doing so craft visualization systems that support comprehension, retention, transfer, and critical thinking. We argue that this reflective essay serves as a first point of departure for initiating dialogue that, we hope, could help further connect educational science and visualization, by proposing future empirical studies that take advantage of interdisciplinary approaches of mutual gain to both communities.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"konrad.schonborn@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Konrad J Sch\u00f6nborn"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"lonni.besancon@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lonni Besan\u00e7on"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Konrad Sch\u00f6nborn"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"In this reflective essay, we explore how educational science can be relevant for visualization research, addressing beneficial intersections between the two communities.","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/8jbmz","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop3b","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1031","time_end":"2024-10-13T17:15:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T16:00:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T16:00:00Z","title":"What Can Educational Science Offer Visualization?

Reducing CH4 emissions helps advance green energy by converting it into a valuable energy source through innovative capture technologies. A real-time continuous monitoring system (CMS) is necessary to detect fugitive and intermittent emissions and provide actionable insights. Integrating spatiotemporal data from satellites, airborne sensors, and ground sensors with inventory data and the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model creates a comprehensive dataset, making CMS feasible but posing significant challenges. These challenges include data alignment and fusion, managing heterogeneity, handling missing values, ensuring resolution integrity, and maintaining geometric and radiometric accuracy.

In cases where two or more power lines go offline, this contingency plan is no longer valid, and they must re-prepare and reason about the network in real time. A key network property that must be balanced is loadability--the range of permissible voltage levels for a specific bus (or node), understood as a function of power and its active (P) and reactive (Q) components. Loadability provides information of how much more demand a specific node can handle, before system became unstable. To increase loadability, the TSO can potentially make control actions that raise or lower P or Q, which results in change the voltage levels required to be within permissible limits. While many methods exist to calculate loadability and represent loadability to end users, there has been little focus on tailoring loadability visualizations to the unique needs of TSOs. In this paper we involve operations domain experts in a human centered design process to prototype two new loadability visualizations for TSOs. We contribute a design paper that yields: (1) a working model of the operator's decision making process, (2) example artifacts of the two data visualization techniques, and (3) a critical qualitative expert review of our designs.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Montreal, Canada"],"email":"dmarino@cim.mcgill.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"David Marino"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"maxwellkeleher@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Maxwell Keleher"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Krakow, Poland"],"email":"krzysztof.chmielowiec@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Krzysztof Chmielowiec"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Montreal, Canada"],"email":"antony.hilliard@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Antony Hilliard"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Krakow, Poland"],"email":"pawel.dawidowski@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pawel Dawidowski"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["David Marino"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop2","slot_id":"w-energyvis-3496","time_end":"2024-10-14T19:00:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-14T16:00:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-14T16:00:00Z","title":"Operator-Centered Design of a Nodal Loadability Network Visualization","uid":"w-energyvis-3496","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"This paper presents a dashboard to find and compare days with similar weather patterns within an 80-year historical weather dataset.

A short power outage is merely a nuisance for most, and may not change people's locations. An outage that lasts for a few hours can result in spoiled food and medical supplies, and people will have to restock spoiled items. Long outages result in temperatures outside tolerable levels in homes, and may prompt people to acquire supplies, such as generators and gas, or change location. The long outages during Winter Storm Uri in Texas resulted in millions of dollars in property damage due to freezing pipes. This level of damage is expected to result in a sharp increase in supply runs and contractor activity. In this paper, we present a tool to explore differences in visiting patterns before, during, and after power outages. It allows to compare different points of interest like medical facilities, grocery stores, hardware stores, and other types of businesses.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, United States"],"email":"andy.berres@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Andy S Berres"},{"affiliations":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"],"email":"nsonga@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Baldwin Nsonga"},{"affiliations":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, United States"],"email":"caitlyn.clark6@icloud.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Caitlyn Clark"},{"affiliations":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, United States"],"email":"bobby.jeffers@nrel.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Robert Jeffers"},{"affiliations":["University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"email":"hagen@cs.uni-kl.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hans Hagen"},{"affiliations":["Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"],"email":"scheuermann@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gerik Scheuermann"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-energyvis/w-energyvis-9875/w-energyvis-9875_Preview.mp4?token=tsVlw0ZOeOysdNfQ1Q9FMVlt54O3hFivdbokYCDQRSo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-energyvis/w-energyvis-9875/w-energyvis-9875_Preview.srt?token=1isu0PYjNMZEIjmSXAlWSh3Xpp2WWat8MM6KQ2Bx4y8&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Andy S Berres"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We present a visual analysis of the impact of the 2021 Texas Power Crisis on building occupancy in Austin, Texas. In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri caused temperatures to rapidly drop up to 50\u2109/25\u2103 below typical Texas winter temperatures (see comparison on the top left), and due to the isolated nature of the Texas powergrid, there was little room for compensation for the additional load and . The top right shows a heatmap comparison of power outages over time (x-axis) for different Texas counties (y-axis). The red line indicates the threshold for the 10% most affected counties (in the tool itself, hovering reveals more information about the counties and the extent of the outages). The tool provides navigation elements for users to select two timeframes they want to compare. In this case, we chose the 3 days with most intense outages, and an equivalent 3-day window two weeks prior, before the winter storm hit. The bottom shows buildings colored by POI type (for buildings with multiple POI, we chose the type with the highest importance \u2013 shown in the legend on the left). The map in the middle shows increases (green) and decreases (purple) in visits during the storm, compared with pre-storm conditions. The changes in visits/occupancy by POI subtype (colored by POI type) are shown on the bottom right. Large Event Spaces (which served as cold shelters) saw an increase in occupancy that\u2019s just a little over the decrease in occupancy of residential homes, and the visits to correctional facilities dropped dramatically.\u00a0 With the exception of the weather layer, all graphics come from MoVis, an interactive prototype we developed.

Summarization for sensemaking involves information compression and insight extraction. Human guidance in sensemaking tasks can prioritize and cluster relevant information for LLMs. However, users must translate their cognitive thinking into natural language to communicate with LLMs. Can we use more readable and operable visual representations to guide the summarization process for sensemaking? Therefore, we propose introducing an intermediate step--a schematic visual workspace for human sensemaking--before the LLM generation to steer and refine the summarization process. We conduct a series of proof-of-concept experiments to investigate the potential for enhancing the summarization by GPT-4 through visual workspaces. Leveraging a textual sensemaking dataset with a ground truth summary, we evaluate the impact of a human-generated visual workspace on LLM-generated summarization of the dataset and assess the effectiveness of space-steered summarization. We categorize several types of extractable information from typical human workspaces that can be injected into engineered prompts to steer the LLM summarization. The results demonstrate how such workspaces can help align an LLM with the ground truth, leading to more accurate summarization results than without the workspaces.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Computer Science Department, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"tangxxwhu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xuxin Tang"},{"affiliations":["Dod, Laurel, United States"],"email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliations":["Department of Defense, College Park, United States"],"email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliations":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"canliu@cityu.edu.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Can Liu"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"naren@cs.vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Naren Ramakrishnan"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"north@vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chris North"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Xuxin Tang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We created an intermediate workspace based on the ground truth of an intelligence analysis dataset to better understand the enhancements in LLM summarization achieved by integrating the worksapce.

To mitigate the information overload inherent to these steps, we present a tool combining automated information highlights, Large Language Model generated textual insights, and visual analytics, facilitating exploration at different levels of detail. We perform a segmentation of the data per analysis area and visually represent each one, making use of automated visual cues to signal which require more attention. Upon user selection of an area, our system provides textual and graphical summaries. The text, acting as a link between the high-level and detailed views of the chosen segment, allows for a quick understanding of relevant details.

However, the projection often lacks connection to the text semantics, due to the opaque nature of text embeddings and non-linear dimension reductions. To address these problems, we propose a gradient-based method for visualizing the spatial semantics of dimensionally reduced text embeddings. This method employs gradients to assess the sensitivity of the projected documents with respect to the underlying words. The method can be applied to existing DR algorithms and text embedding models. Using these gradients, we designed a visualization system that incorporates spatial word clouds into the document projection space to illustrate the impactful text features.

One of them is Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), a prompting strategy and framework for language model inference and problem-solving. It allows the model to explore multiple solution paths and select the best course of action, producing a tree-like structure of intermediate steps (i.e., thoughts). This method was shown to be effective for several problem types. However, the official implementation has a high barrier to usage as it requires setup overhead and incorporates task-specific problem templates which are difficult to generalize to new problem types. It also does not allow user interaction to improve or suggest new thoughts. We introduce iToT (interactive Tree-of- Thoughts), a generalized and interactive Tree of Thought prompting system. iToT allows users to explore each step of the model\u2019s problem-solving process as well as to correct and extend the model\u2019s thoughts. iToT revolves around a visual interface that facilitates simple and generic ToT usage and transparentizes the problem-solving process to users. This facilitates a better understanding of which thoughts and considerations lead to the model\u2019s final decision.

Following this, we computed and visualized the dissimilarities between these images, and overlaid their differences. Our findings suggest that the positional patterns across a poem play a pivotal role in effective poetry clustering, as demonstrated by our newly computed metrics.

However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. We identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, we explore the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages.

Like creative writing, where one reads to write a story, data professionals must effectively ``read\" visualizations to create compelling data stories. In education, helping students develop these skills can be achieved through exercises that ask them to create narratives from data plots, demonstrating both ``show\" (describing the plot) and ``tell\" (interpreting the plot). Providing formative feedback on these exercises is crucial but challenging in large-scale educational settings with limited resources. This study explores using GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM, to generate and evaluate narratives from data plots.

The Jacobi set for two Morse functions is the set of all points where the functions' gradients are linearly dependent. Both the segmentation of the domain by Jacobi sets and the Jacobi sets themselves have proven to be useful tools in multi-field visualization, data analysis in various applications, and for accelerating extraction algorithms. On a triangulated grid, they can be calculated by a piecewise linear interpolation. In practice, Jacobi sets can become very complex and large due to noise and numerical errors. Some techniques for simplifying Jacobi sets exist, but these only reduce individual elements such as noise or are purely theoretical. These techniques often only change the visual representation of the Jacobi sets, but not the underlying data. In this paper, we present an algorithm that simplifies the Jacobi sets for 2D bivariate scalar fields and at the same time modifies the underlying bivariate scalar fields while preserving the essential structures of the fields. We use a neighborhood graph to select the areas to be reduced and collapse these cells individually. We investigate the influence of different neighborhood graphs and present an adaptation for the visualization of Jacobi sets that take the collapsed cells into account.

The classic definition is based on a continuous view of the gradient of a scalar function where its zeros are the critical points. These points are connected via gradient curves and surfaces emanating from saddle points, known as separatrices. In a discrete setting, the Morse-Smale complex is commonly extracted by constructing a combinatorial gradient assuming the steepest descent direction. Previous works have shown that this method results in a geometric embedding of the separatrices that can be fundamentally different from those in the continuous case. To achieve a similar embedding, different approaches for constructing a combinatorial gradient were proposed. In this paper, we show that these approaches generate a different topology, i.e., the connectivity between critical points changes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the steepest descent method can compute topologically and geometrically accurate Morse-Smale complexes when applied to certain types of grids. Based on these observations, we suggest a method to attain both geometric and topological accuracy for the Morse-Smale complex of data sampled on a uniform grid.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"email":"sonlt@kth.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Son Le Thanh"},{"affiliations":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"email":"ankele@iai.uni-bonn.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Ankele"},{"affiliations":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"email":"weinkauf@kth.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tino Weinkauf"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Son Le Thanh"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Shown is the Morse-Smale complex of an analytic function representing a circle engraved in a tilted plane.

The proposed framework, called Tetra-Spark, features optimized approaches to locally compute many connectivity relations by first retrieving the Vertex-Tetrahedron (VT) relation. This strategy significantly improves Tetra-Spark's efficiency in performing morphology computations on large tetrahedral meshes.To prove the effectiveness and scalability of such a framework, we conduct a comprehensive comparison against a vanilla Spark implementation for the analysis of tetrahedral meshes. Our experimental evaluation shows that Tetra-Spark achieves up to a 78x speedup and reduces memory usage by up to 80% when retrieving connectivity relations with the VT relation available. This optimized design further accelerates subsequent morphology computations, resulting in up to a 47.7x speedup.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, United States"],"email":"yhqian@umd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuehui Qian"},{"affiliations":["Clemson University, Clemson, United States"],"email":"guoxil@clemson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoxi Liu"},{"affiliations":["Clemson University, Clemson, United States"],"email":"fiurici@clemson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Federico Iuricich"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"deflo@umiacs.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Leila De Floriani"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yuehui Qian"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Figure: (a) The time cost (in minutes) for extracting connectivity relations and executing the algorithm in computing Forman gradient.

In recent years, several approaches have been introduced and improved to analyze these fields using topological features, such as degenerate tensor locations, i.e., the tensor has repeated eigenvalues, or normal surfaces. Traditionally, the identification of such features has been limited to single tensor fields. However, it has become common to create ensembles to account for uncertainties and variability in simulations and measurements. In this work, we explore novel methods for describing and visualizing degenerate tensor locations in 3D symmetric second-order tensor field ensembles. We base our considerations on the tensor mode and analyze its practicality in characterizing the uncertainty of degenerate tensor locations before proposing a variety of visualization strategies to effectively communicate degenerate tensor information. We demonstrate our techniques for synthetic and simulation data sets.The results indicate that the interplay of different descriptions for uncertainty can effectively convey information on degenerate tensor locations.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"tadea.schmitz@uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tadea Schmitz"},{"affiliations":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-uncertainty/w-uncertainty-1007/w-uncertainty-1007_Preview.mp4?token=8rfUf11SCsATf7UzC6-xDYLlbQCurLQyjEYw9YyHGNI&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Tim Gerrits"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Uncertainty visualizations for eight simulation results describing stresses in an O-ring with varying anisotropy parameter.

One common approach is to use multiple forecast visualizations, in which multiple forecasts are plotted on the same graph. This provides an implicit representation of the uncertainty in the data, but it is not clear how many forecasts to show, or how viewers might be influenced by seeing the more extreme forecasts rather than those closer to the mean. In this study, we showed participants forecasts of wind speed data and they made decisions based on their predictions about the future wind speed. We allowed participants to choose how many forecasts to view prior to making a decision, and we manipulated the ordering of the forecasts and the cost of each additional forecast. We found that participants viewed more forecasts when the outcome was more ambiguous. The order of the forecasts had little impact on their decisions when there was no cost for the additional information. However, when there was a cost for each forecast, the participants were much more likely to make a guess based on only the first forecast shown. In this case, showing one of the extreme forecasts first led to less optimal decisions.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, United States"],"email":"lematze@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Laura Matzen"},{"affiliations":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, United States"],"email":"mcstite@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mallory C Stites"},{"affiliations":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, United States"],"email":"kmdivis@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kristin M Divis"},{"affiliations":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"email":"abendeck3@gatech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alexander Bendeck"},{"affiliations":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"email":"john.stasko@cc.gatech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"John Stasko"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lace M.

First, state-of-the-art probabilistic uncertainty visual- ization framework is limited to bivariate data (two variables). Sec- ond, the existing uncertainty visualization algorithms use compu- tationally intensive techniques and lack support for cross-platform portability. Third, as a consequence of the computational expense, integration into interactive production visualization tools is imprac- tical. In this work, we address all three issues and make a threefold contribution. First, we generalize the state-of-the-art probabilis- tic framework for bivariate data to multivariate data with a arbi- trary number of variables.

Tackling these increasing challenges requires novel approaches that integrate expertise across multiple domains, including computer science, engineering, climate science, and public health. Urban computing can play a pivotal role in these efforts by integrating data from multiple sources to support decision-making and provide actionable insights into weather patterns, infrastructure weaknesses, and population vulnerabilities. However, the capacity to leverage technological advancements varies significantly between the Global South and Global North. In this paper, we present two multiyear, multidisciplinary projects situated in Chicago, USA and Niter\u00f3i, Brazil, highlighting the opportunities and limitations of urban computing in these diverse contexts. Reflecting on our experiences, we then discuss the essential requirements, as well as existing gaps, for visual analytics tools that facilitate the understanding and mitigation of climate-related risks in urban environments.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Illinois, Chicago, United States"],"email":"carolvfs@illinois.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Carolina Veiga"},{"affiliations":["University of Illinois, Chicago, United States"],"email":"sharmaa@illinois.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ashish Sharma"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niter\u00f3i, Brazil"],"email":"danielcmo@ic.uff.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel de Oliveira"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal Fluminense , Niteroi, Brazil"],"email":"mlage@ic.uff.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marcos Lage"},{"affiliations":["University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, United States"],"email":"fabiom@uic.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fabio Miranda"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fabio Miranda"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop9","slot_id":"w-vis4climate-1038","time_end":"2024-10-14T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-14T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-14T12:30:00Z","title":"Urban Computing for Climate And Environmental Justice: Early Perspectives From Two Research Initiatives","uid":"w-vis4climate-1038","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},{"abstract":"This position statement discusses the challenges of designing visualizations to enhance the carbon numeracy of the general public.

While various machine learning models have been proposed to address this issue, many of them fall short in terms of interpretability, unable to articulate how they arrive at their predictions. We recently introduced an interpretable machine learning model that predicts splicing outcomes based on input sequence and structure. Here, we present a series of interactive data visualization tools to illuminate the process behind the network's predictions. Specifically, we introduce visualizations that emphasize both the global and local interpretability of our model. These visualizations emphasize the clear intermediate reasoning stages of our model that trace how specific RNA features contribute to the final splicing prediction. We highlight how these visualizations can be used to explain the network\u2019s performance on prior training and validation datasets. Finally, we explore how these interactive visualizations can be harnessed to facilitate domain-specific applications, such as rational design of RNA sequences with desired splicing outcomes.

The architecture is quite complicated and the description in the paper can be overwhelming, so we made a much more accessible (but just as detailed!) visual walkthrough.  There are already many great explanations of the motivation for protein structure prediction, the CASP competition, model failure modes, debates about evaluations, implications for biotech, etc. so we don\u2019t focus on any of that. Instead we explore the how.   How are these molecules represented in the model and what are all of the operations that convert their sequences into a predicted structure? As we walk through every step of this process, we explain 30 algorithms in ~40 clear diagrams, then share some thoughts on how they fit into the broader landscape of ML trends.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Stanford University, Palo Alto, United States"],"email":"elanasimon95@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Elana P Simon"},{"affiliations":["Stanford, Stanford, United States"],"email":"jsilberg@stanford.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jake Silberg"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Anne Marx "," Diego Arapovic"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"associated2","slot_id":"w-visxai-6211","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"The Illustrated AlphaFold","uid":"w-visxai-6211","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UUkftG2KH5o?start=4814"},{"abstract":"Prompt engineering is an emerging field where researchers are discovering new patterns of communication between humans and large language models.

However, their interpretability remains challenging. We overcome the limitations of earlier studies by offering interactive components, engaging the user in the exploration of the Vision Transformer (ViT). Furthermore, we offer various complementary explainability methods to challenge the insight they provide. Key contributions include:  - Interactive analysis of the ViT architecture and explainability methods. - Identifying critical information from input images used for classification. - Investigating neuron activations at various depths to understand learned features. - Introducing an innovative adaptation of activation maximization for attention scores to trace attention head focus across network layers. - Highlighting the limitations of each method through occlusion-based interaction.  Our findings include that ViTs tend to generalize well by relying on a broad set of object features and contexts seen in the input image. Furthermore, the focus of neurons and attention heads shifts to more complex patterns at deeper layers. We also acknowledge that we cannot rely on a single explainability method to understand the decision-making process of transformers. Our blog post provides an engaging and multi-facetted interpretation of the ViT to the readers by combining interactivity with key research questions.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["ETH Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"anmarx@student.ethz.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Anne Marx"},{"affiliations":["Eth Zurich , Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"yumikimi381@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yumi Kim"},{"affiliations":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"luca.sichi@hotmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luca Sichi"},{"affiliations":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"diego.arapovic@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Diego Arapovic"},{"affiliations":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland","ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"jsanguino@student.ethz.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Javier Sanguino Bautiste"},{"affiliations":["ETH, Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"rita.sevastjanova@inf.ethz.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Rita Sevastjanova"},{"affiliations":["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"email":"melassady@ai.ethz.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mennatallah El-Assady"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Anne Marx "," Diego Arapovic"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"associated2","slot_id":"w-visxai-9042","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"Explainability Perspectives on a Vision Transformer: From Global Architecture to Single Neuron","uid":"w-visxai-9042","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UUkftG2KH5o?start=3844"},{"abstract":"","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Adam Pearce"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"associated2","slot_id":"w-visxai-102","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"Closing Keynote: Why Aren't We Using Visualizations to Interact with AI?","uid":"w-visxai-102","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""}],"time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"VISxAI: 7th Workshop on Visualization for AI Explainability","track":"bayshore1","youtube_id":"UUkftG2KH5o","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/UUkftG2KH5o","zoom_private_link":"https://ieeevis.zoom.us/j/81253735757?pwd=4emLPNBEClXZEq889DZbdXonpaFM8g.1","zoom_private_meeting":"81253735757","zoom_private_password":"qnaBlR"}]}}
