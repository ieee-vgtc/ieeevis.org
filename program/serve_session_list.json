Cuneiform signs are obtained by impressing a stylus on fresh clay tablets. For certain purposes, e.g. authentication by seal imprint, some cuneiform tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes, which cannot be opened without destroying them. The aim of our interdisciplinary project is the non-invasive study of clay tablets. A portable X-ray micro-CT scanner is developed to acquire density data of such artifacts on a high-resolution, regular 3D grid at collection sites. The resulting volume data is processed through feature-preserving denoising, extraction of high-accuracy surfaces using a manifold dual marching cubes algorithm and extraction of local features by enhanced curvature rendering and ambient occlusion. For the non-invasive study of cuneiform inscriptions, the tablet is virtually separated from its envelope by curvature-based segmentation. The computational- and data-intensive algorithms are optimized for near-real-time offline usage with limited resources at collection sites. To visualize the complexity-reduced and octree-based compressed representation of surfaces, we develop and implement an interactive application. To facilitate the analysis of such clay tablets, we implement shape-based feature extraction algorithms to enhance cuneiform recognition. Our workflow supports innovative 3D display and interaction techniques such as autostereoscopic displays and gesture control.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"stephan.olbrich@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stephan Olbrich"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Nanterre, France"],"email":"cecile.michel@cnrs.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"C\u00e9cile Michel"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christian.schroer@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christian Schroer"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"samaneh.ehteram@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Samaneh Ehteram"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.schropp@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Schropp"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"philipp.paetzold@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Philipp Paetzold"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Andreas Beckert"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Virtual unpacking of an ancient clay tablet enclosed in another layer of clay.

While DR methods are often applied to typical DR benchmark data sets in the literature, they might suffer from high runtime complexity and memory requirements, making them unsuitable for large data visualization especially in environments outside of high-performance computing. To perform DR on large data sets, we propose the use of out-of-sample extensions.Such extensions allow inserting new data into existing projections, which we leverage to iteratively project data into a reference projection that consists only of a small manageable subset. This process makes it possible to perform DR out-of-core on large data, which would otherwise not be possible due to memory and runtime limitations. For metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), we contribute an implementation with out-of-sample projection capability since typical software libraries do not support it. We provide an evaluation of the projection quality of five common DR algorithms (MDS, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and autoencoders) using quality metrics from the literature and analyze the trade-off between the size of the reference set and projection quality. The runtime behavior of the algorithms is also quantified with respect to reference set size, out-of-sample batch size, and dimensionality of the data sets. Furthermore, we compare the out-of-sample approach to other recently introduced DR methods, such as PaCMAP and TriMAP, which claim to handle larger data sets than traditional approaches. To showcase the usefulness of DR on this large scale, we contribute a use case where we analyze ensembles of streamlines amounting to one billion projected instances.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"lucareichmann01@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luca Marcel Reichmann"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"david.haegele@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David H\u00e4gele"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Weiskopf"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/a-ldav/a-ldav-1003/a-ldav-1003_Preview.mp4?token=PYJw_loXL4L1qAH_hlEUHMBLIR9img4Wuf2hw1VfGqw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/a-ldav/a-ldav-1003/a-ldav-1003_Preview.srt?token=wztCbEzC5jXSgn8_YRdZ6ycRd17DxhBRfIfdjynStm0&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Luca Reichmann"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The projections show the results of dimensionality reduction using the out-of-sample approach with data sets containing up to 50 million data points.

For example, understanding climate simulations based on the long-term average of temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables is essential to predicting and establishing root causes of future undesirable scenarios and assessing possible mitigation strategies. Unfortunately, bottlenecks in petascale workflows restrict scientists' ability to analyze and visualize the necessary information due to requirements for extensive computational resources, obstacles in data accessibility, and inefficient analysis algorithms. This paper presents an approach to managing, visualizing, and analyzing petabytes of data within a browser on equipment ranging from the top NASA supercomputer to commodity hardware like a laptop. Our approach is based on a novel data fabric abstraction layer that allows querying scientific information in a form that is user-friendly while hiding the complexities of dealing with file systems or cloud services. We also optimize network utilization while streaming from petascale repositories through state-of-the-art progressive compression algorithms. Based on this abstraction, we provide customizable dashboards that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, offering straightforward access to vast amounts of data typically not available to those without access to uniquely expensive hardware resources. Our dashboards provide and improve the ability to access and, more importantly, use massive data for a wide range of users, from top scientists with access to leadership-class computing environments to undergraduate students of disadvantaged backgrounds from minority-serving institutions. We focus on NASA's use of petascale climate datasets as an example of particular societal impact and, therefore, a case where achieving equity in science participation is critical. In particular, we validate our approach by improving the ability of climate scientist to explore their data even on the top NASA supercomputer, introducing the ability to study their data in a fully interactive environment instead of being limited to using pre-choreographed videos that can take days to generate each. We also successfully introduced the same dashboards and simplified training material in an undergraduate class on Geospatial Analysis in a minority-serving campus (Utah State Banding) with 69% of the Native American students and 86% being low-income. The same dashboards are also released in simplified form to the general public, providing an unparalleled democratization for the access and use of climate data that can be extended to most scientific domains.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"aashishpanta0@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Aashish Panta"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"xuanhuang@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuan Huang"},{"affiliations":["NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, United States"],"email":"nina.mccurdy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nina McCurdy"},{"affiliations":["NASA, mountain View, United States"],"email":"david.ellsworth@nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Ellsworth"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"amy.a.gooch@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Amy Gooch"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"scrgiorgio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Giorgio Scorzelli"},{"affiliations":["NASA, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"hector.torres.gutierrez@jpl.nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hector Torres"},{"affiliations":["caltech, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"pklein@caltech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Patrice Klein"},{"affiliations":["Utah State University Blanding, Blanding, United States"],"email":"gustavo.ovando@usu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gustavo Ovando-Montejo"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"pascucci.valerio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Valerio Pascucci"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Aashish Panta"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We provide unprecedented equitable access to massive data via our novel data fabric abstraction enabled by dashboards on commodity desktop computers with a simple weblink for everyone from top NASA scientists to students in disadvantaged communities to the general public.

public transport systems are crucial for sustainable urban development as cities face increasing mobility demands. Yet, many public transport networks struggle to meet diverse user needs due to historical development, urban constraints, and financial limitations. Traditionally, planning of transport network structure is often based on limited surveys, expert opinions, or partial usage statistics. This provides an incomplete basis for decision-making. We introduce an data-driven approach to public transport planning and optimization, calculating detailed accessibility measures at the individual housing level. Our visual analytics workflow combines population-group-based simulations with dynamic infrastructure analysis, utilizing a scenario-based model to simulate daily travel patterns of varied demographic groups, including schoolchildren, students, workers, and pensioners. These population groups, each with unique mobility requirements and routines, interact with the transport system under different scenarios traveling to and from Points of Interest (POI), assessed through travel time calculations. Results are visualized through heatmaps, density maps, and network overlays, as well as detailed statistics. Our system allows us to analyze both the underlying data and simulation results on multiple levels of granularity, delivering both broad insights and granular details. Case studies with the city of Konstanz, Germany reveal key areas where public transport does not meet specific needs, confirmed through a formative user study. Due to the high cost of changing legacy networks, our analysis facilitates the identification of strategic enhancements, such as optimized schedules or rerouting, and few targeted stop relocations, highlighting consequential variations in accessibility to pinpointing critical service gaps. Our research advances urban transport analytics by providing policymakers and citizens with a system that delivers both broad insights with granular detail into public transport services for a data-driven quality assessment at housing-level detail.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"yannick.metz@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yannick Metz"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"dennis-fabian.ackermann@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dennis Ackermann"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"keim@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Keim"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"max.fischer@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Maximilian T.

It synthesizes perspectives from Automated Data Science (AutoDS) and Interactive Data Visualization (VIS), which traditionally represent opposing ends of the human-machine spectrum. While AutoDS aims to enhance efficiency by reducing human tasks, VIS emphasizes the importance of nuanced understanding, innovation, and context provided by human involvement. This paper examines these dichotomies through an online survey and advocates for a balanced approach that harmonizes the efficiency of automation with the irreplaceable insights of human expertise. Ultimately, we address the essential question of not just what we can automate, but what we should automate, seeking strategies that prioritize technological advancement alongside the fundamental need for human oversight.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Boston, United States"],"email":"jen@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jen Rogers"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, INRIA, Orsay, France"],"email":"mehdi.chakhchoukh@universite-paris-saclay.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mehdi Chakhchoukh"},{"affiliations":["Leiden Universiteit, Leiden, Netherlands"],"email":"anastacio@aim.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marie Anastacio"},{"affiliations":["Tulane University, New Orleans, United States"],"email":"rfaust1@tulane.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Rebecca Faust"},{"affiliations":["University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom"],"email":"cagatay.turkay@warwick.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Cagatay Turkay"},{"affiliations":["University of Wyoming, Laramie, United States"],"email":"larsko@uwyo.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lars Kotthoff"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"steffen.koch@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Steffen Koch"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"andreas.kerren@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Kerren"},{"affiliations":["University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"email":"bernard@ifi.uzh.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"J\u00fcrgen Bernard"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1002/s-vds-1002_Preview.mp4?token=95WeM8irbKnh9Du-lE9XJTq36pdxWIujIGgIGk3Z1n4&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/s-vds/s-vds-1002/s-vds-1002_Preview.srt?token=8fssMCCBdK9YKDz1Yu5pDc-mAEXHleiX_h-nOSWcRrc&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Jen Rogers"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The tug-of-war between automation and human involvement in data science: As automation technology advances, the balance between human intuition and machine efficiency becomes increasingly critical.

We present a novel dimensionality reduction-based visualization for categorical data, which is based on defining the distance of two data items as the number of varying attributes. Our technique enables users to pre-attentively detect groups of similar data items and observe the properties of the projection, such as attributes strongly influencing the embedding. Our prototype visually encodes data properties in an enhanced scatterplot-like visualization, visualizing attributes in the background to show the distribution of categories. In addition, we propose two graph-based measures to quantify the plot's visual quality, which rank attributes according to their contribution to cluster cohesion. To demonstrate the capabilities of our similarity-based projection method, we compare it to Euler diagrams and Parallel Sets regarding visual scalability and evaluate it quantitatively on seven real-world datasets using a range of common quality measures. Further, we validate the benefits of our approach through an expert study with five data scientists analyzing the Titanic and Mushroom dataset with up to 23 attributes and 8124 category combinations. Our results indicate that our Categorical Data Map offers an effective analysis method for large datasets with a high number of category combinations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"frederik.dennig@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Frederik L.

By leveraging visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and interactive modules, the tool allows users to investigate how biases such as miscalibration, stereotypes, and filter bubbles affect their recommendations. Informed by in-depth user interviews, both general users and researchers can benefit from increased transparency and personalized impact assessments, ultimately fostering a better understanding of algorithmic biases and contributing to more equitable recommendation outcomes.

Building on established concepts from linguistics, we examine the interdependency between mental and language models, discussing how LLMs influence and are influenced by human cognition and societal context. We introduce three primary theories to conceptualize such influences: Recontextualization, Standardization, and Semantic Dementia, illustrating how LLMs drive, standardize, and potentially degrade language semantics.Our subsequent review categorizes methods for visualizing semantic change into frequency-based, embedding-based, and context-based techniques, being first in assessing their effectiveness in capturing linguistic evolution: Embedding-based methods are highlighted as crucial for a detailed semantic analysis, reflecting both broad trends and specific linguistic changes. We underscore the need for novel visual, interactive tools to monitor and explain semantic changes induced by LLMs, ensuring the preservation of linguistic diversity and mitigating linguistic biases.

However, how sets should be visualized when the data are uncertain is still an open research challenge. To address the problem of depicting uncertainty in set visualization, we ask 1) which aspects of set type data can be affected by uncertainty and 2) which characteristics of uncertainty influence the visualization design. We answer these research questions by first describing a conceptual framework that brings together 1) the information that is primarily relevant in sets (i.e., set membership, set attributes, and element attributes) and 2) different plausible categories of (un)certainty (i.e., certainty, undefined uncertainty as a binary fact, and defined uncertainty as quantifiable measure). Following the structure of our framework, we systematically discuss basic visualization examples of integrating uncertainty in set visualizations. We draw on existing knowledge about general uncertainty visualization and previous evidence of its effectiveness.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"christian.tominski@uni-rostock.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christian Tominski"},{"affiliations":"","email":"m.behrisch@uu.nl","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Michael Behrisch"},{"affiliations":"","email":"susanne.bleisch@fhnw.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Susanne Bleisch"},{"affiliations":"","email":"sara.fabrikant@geo.uzh.ch","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sara Irina Fabrikant"},{"affiliations":"","email":"eva.mayr@donau-uni.ac.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Eva Mayr"},{"affiliations":"","email":"miksch@ifs.tuwien.ac.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Silvia Miksch"},{"affiliations":"","email":"helen.purchase@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Helen Purchase"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-cga/v-cga-10198358/v-cga-10198358_Preview.mp4?token=Mgq_Nnpy6uatRSqLhcqCj4lNl75aRjlj9BMREc1eD9Q&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-cga/v-cga-10198358/v-cga-10198358_Preview.srt?token=W8A4RCOde5v9L6Pp5c4soF_xKoPB1ZvUhyZZpbB29kw&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Michael Behrisch"],"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2023.3300441","external_paper_link":"","fno":"10198358","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Visualizing uncertainty in set-type data is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.

How do drugs influence these processes? These are difficult questions that we can attempt to answer with a combination of time-series microscopy experiments, classification algorithms, and data visualization.However, collecting this type of data and applying algorithms to segment and track cells and construct lineages of proliferation is error-prone; and identifying the errors can be challenging since it often requires cross-checking multiple data types. Similarly, analyzing and communicating the results necessitates synthesizing different data types into a single narrative. State-of-the-art visualization methods for such data use independent line charts, tree diagrams, and images in separate views. However, this spatial separation requires the viewer of these charts to combine the relevant pieces of data in memory. To simplify this challenging task, we describe design principles for weaving cell images, time-series data, and tree data into a cohesive visualization. Our design principles are based on choosing a primary data type that drives the layout and integrates the other data types into that layout. We then introduce Aardvark, a system that uses these principles to implement novel visualization techniques. Based on Aardvark, we demonstrate the utility of each of these approaches for discovery, communication, and data debugging in a series of case studies.

However, three key challenges with existing visualizations make it difficult for clinicians to find information efficiently. First, the document embeddings used in these visualizations are generated statically by pretrained language models, which cannot adapt to the user's evolving interest. Second, existing document visualization techniques cannot effectively display how the documents are relevant to users\u2019 interest, making it difficult for users to identify the most pertinent information. Third, existing embedding generation and visualization processes suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to understand, trust and use the result for decision-making. In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics pipeline for user-driven document representation and iterative information seeking (VADIS). VADIS introduces a prompt-based attention model (PAM) that generates dynamic document embedding and document relevance adjusted to the user's query. To effectively visualize these two pieces of information, we design a new document map that leverages a circular grid layout to display documents based on both their relevance to the query and the semantic similarity. Additionally, to improve the interpretability, we introduce a corpus-level attention visualization method to improve the user's understanding of the model focus and to enable the users to identify potential oversight. This visualization, in turn, empowers users to refine, update and introduce new queries, thereby facilitating a dynamic and iterative information-seeking experience. We evaluated VADIS quantitatively and qualitatively on a real-world dataset of biomedical research papers to demonstrate its effectiveness.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"qiu.580@buckeyemail.osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Rui Qiu"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"tu.253@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yamei Tu"},{"affiliations":["Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, United States"],"email":"yenp@wustl.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Po-Yin Yen"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States"],"email":"hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1802/v-full-1802_Preview.mp4?token=LA7YlgNQGkiZLyHEnN17Ob983PPFPSfpWFr16hnzl8M&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1802/v-full-1802_Preview.srt?token=_kmNMLgzJ1-tuMdPqbZvT77tnne1hHmQvmqvnSs1RrA&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Rui Qiu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Traditional document maps cluster documents based on static embeddings, leading to confusing grouping with inconsistent semantic concepts.

To scout suitable players, coaches and analysts need to consider whether the players will perform well in a new team, which is hard to learn directly from their historical performances. Match simulation methods have been introduced to scout players by estimating their expected contributions to a new team. However, they usually focus on the simulation of match results and hardly support interactive analysis to navigate potential target players and compare them in fine-grained simulated behaviors. In this work, we propose a visual analytics method to assist soccer player scouting based on match simulation. We construct a two-level match simulation framework for estimating both match results and player behaviors when a player comes to a new team. Based on the framework, we develop a visual analytics system, Team-Scouter, to facilitate the simulative-based soccer player scouting process through player navigation, comparison, and investigation. With our system, coaches and analysts can find potential players suitable for the team and compare them on historical and expected performances. For an in-depth investigation of the players' expected performances, the system provides a visual comparison between the simulated behaviors of the player and the actual ones. The usefulness and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world dataset and an expert interview.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"caoanqi28@163.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anqi Cao"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"xxie@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiao Xie"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"2366385033@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Runjin Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"1282533692@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuxin Tian"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"fanmu_032@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mu Fan"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"zhang_hui@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1031/v-full-1031_Preview.mp4?token=lZJeB6Xf0ge_YdGbBTun3RHwlGjYyPFmJbqOYHb7olQ&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1031/v-full-1031_Preview.srt?token=ioob5IkjvKKKvgqxCtdJinqPHLJNypauW9vO7Yg4uxw&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Anqi Cao"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"System user interface.

Both sports fans and experts have a demand for analyzing sports tactics. Existing approaches allow users to visually perceive the multivariate tactical effects. However, these approaches require users to experience a complex reasoning process to connect the multiple interactions within each tactic to the final tactical effect. In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs. Based on the framework, we design and develop Smartboard, an agent-based interactive visualization system for fine-grained tactical analysis, especially for play design.

To tackle these challenges, we present Sportify, a Visual Question Answering system that integrates narratives and embedded visualization for demystifying basketball tactical questions, aiding fans in understanding various game aspects. We propose three novel action visualizations (i.e., Pass, Cut, and Screen) to demonstrate critical action sequences. To explain the reasoning and logic behind players\u2019 actions, we leverage a large-language model (LLM) to generate narratives. We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations. We evaluated Sportify with basketball fans to investigate its impact on understanding of tactics, and how different personal perspectives of narratives impact the understanding of complex tactic with action visualizations. Our evaluation with basketball fans demonstrates Sportify\u2019s capability to deepen tactical insights and amplify the viewing experience.

With their investment knowledge and professional skills, fund managers gain a competitive advantage over the average investor in the market. Consequently, investors prefer entrusting their investments to fund managers rather than directly investing in funds. For these investors, the primary concern is selecting a suitable fund manager. While previous studies have employed quantitative or qualitative methods to analyze various aspects of fund managers, such as performance metrics, personal characteristics, and performance persistence, they often face challenges when dealing with a large candidate space. Moreover, distinguishing whether a fund manager's performance stems from skill or luck poses a challenge, making it difficult to align with investors' preferences in the selection process. To address these challenges, this study characterizes the requirements of investors in selecting suitable fund managers and proposes an interactive visual analytics system called FMLens. This system streamlines the fund manager selection process, allowing investors to efficiently assess and deconstruct fund managers' investment styles and abilities across multiple dimensions. Additionally, the system empowers investors to scrutinize and compare fund managers' performances. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through two case studies and a qualitative user study. Feedback from domain experts indicates that the system excels in analyzing fund managers from diverse perspectives, enhancing the efficiency of fund manager evaluation and selection.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Longfei Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chen Cheng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"He Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiyuan Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yun Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuanwu Yue"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wong Kam-Kwai"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haipeng Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Suting Hong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quan Li"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243394745/v-tvcg-20243394745_Preview.mp4?token=S_DhSMZGe1pa7MrGSlMaB6fb6AOeVwyJ8Vq6x2taTpw&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243394745/v-tvcg-20243394745_Preview.srt?token=5bL8lQRkexpMVVbZFfcuYdKEFLNpR__BUaDOBP2BXqY&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Longfei Chen"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3394745","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"FMLens consists of four views: (A) The FM Overview serves as a summary of the fund manager candidate space.

Machine learning methods for impact dynamics analysis are incomprehensible and rigid in terms of their interpretability and transparency, whilst stakeholders require interactive tools for informed decision-making. Nevertheless, developing such a tool is challenging due to the substantial, heterogeneous NFT transaction data and the requirements for flexible, customized interactions. To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects. We first conduct a formative study and summarize analysis criteria, including substitution mechanisms, impact attributes, and design requirements from stakeholders. Next, we propose the Minimal Substitution Model to simulate substitutive systems of NFT projects that can be feasibly represented as node-link graphs. Particularly, we utilize attribute-aware techniques to embed the project status and stakeholder behaviors in the layout design. Accordingly, we develop a multi-view visual analytics system, namely NFTracer, allowing interactive analysis of impact dynamics in NFT transactions. We demonstrate the informativeness, effectiveness, and usability of NFTracer by performing two case studies with domain experts and one user study with stakeholders. The studies suggest that NFT projects featuring a higher degree of similarity are more likely to substitute each other.

However, as the number of classes increases, it is challenging to generate a high-quality color assignment result that accommodates all classes simultaneously. A practical solution is to organize classes into a hierarchy and then dynamically assign colors during exploration. However, existing color assignment methods fall short in generating high-quality color assignment results and dynamically aligning them with hierarchical structures. To address this issue, we develop a dynamic color assignment method for hierarchical data, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. This method simultaneously considers color discriminability, color harmony, and spatial distribution at each hierarchical level. By using the colors of parent classes to guide the color assignment of their child classes, our method further promotes both consistency and clarity across hierarchical levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating dynamic color assignment results with quantitative experiments and a user study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"jiashu0717c@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiashu Chen"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"vicayang496@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"jiazl22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zelin Jia"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"tarolancy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lanxi Xiao"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"shixia@tsinghua.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1595/v-full-1595_Preview.mp4?token=toj6GxPoOhr1jLn6j9nD71SzjSzQTxHw6k3YcrcXjAo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1595/v-full-1595_Preview.srt?token=jIle7eUQz-qE5I07DktS3QVaM3zuo11YTABZfXIlcjc&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Weikai Yang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Based on user exploration, our method dynamically selects the color range and assigns colors to classes within the range, which ensures high discriminability and harmony at each level and maintains consistency across different levels.","keywords":["Color assignment, Hierarchical Visualization, Discriminability, Harmony."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/e4b5u/?view_only=68cc67c194c443b498bd2545ef551faa","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, both PCS and external","paper_award":"honorable","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14742","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full10","slot_id":"v-full-1595","time_end":"2024-10-16T19:51:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-16T19:39:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-16T19:39:00Z","title":"Dynamic Color Assignment for Hierarchical Data","uid":"v-full-1595","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"Shape is commonly used to distinguish between categories in multi-class scatterplots. However, existing guidelines for choosing effective shape palettes rely largely on intuition and do not consider how these needs may change as the number of categories increases. Unlike color, shapes can not be represented by a numerical space, making it difficult to propose general guidelines or design heuristics for using shape effectively. This paper presents a series of four experiments evaluating the efficiency of 39 shapes across three tasks: relative mean judgment tasks, expert preference, and correlation estimation. Our results show that conventional means for reasoning about shapes, such as filled versus unfilled, are insufficient to inform effective palette design. Further, even expert palettes vary significantly in their use of shape and corresponding effectiveness. To support effective shape palette design, we developed a model based on pairwise relations between shapes in our experiments and the number of shapes required for a given design. We embed this model in a palette design tool to give designers agency over shape selection while incorporating empirical elements of perceptual performance captured in our study. Our model advances understanding of shape perception in visualization contexts and provides practical design guidelines that can help improve categorical data encodings.

We found that, when only informed about the total numerical value represented by the whole cartogram without any legend, the distribution of estimates for individual regions was centered near the true value with substantial spread.

Comparing differences between regions or between cartograms revealed that legends and grid lines slowed the estimation without improving accuracy.

Each sentence is a comparison: the mean of these is higher than those; this difference is smaller than that. What determines which comparisons are made first? The viewer's goals and expertise matter, but the way that values are visually grouped together within the chart also impacts those comparisons. Research from psychology suggests that comparisons involve multiple steps. First, the viewer divides the visualization into a set of units. This might include a single bar or a grouped set of bars. Then the viewer selects and compares two of these units, perhaps noting that one pair of bars is longer than another. Viewers might take an additional third step and perform a second-order comparison, perhaps determining that the difference between one pair of bars is greater than the difference between another pair. We create a visual comparison taxonomy that allows us to develop and test a sequence of hypotheses about which comparisons people are more likely to make when reading a visualization. We find that people tend to compare two groups before comparing two individual bars and that second-order comparisons are rare. Visual cues like spatial proximity and color can influence which elements are grouped together and selected for comparison, with spatial proximity being a stronger grouping cue. Interestingly, once the viewer grouped together and compared a set of bars, regardless of whether the group is formed by spatial proximity or color similarity, they no longer consider other possible groupings in their comparisons.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andrew Lovett"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Steven Franconeri"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233289292/v-tvcg-20233289292_Preview.mp4?token=FioY-BPSr_2MbWrgkD2XLq8GLNsMALBaddZ05hvtkfI&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Cindy Xiong Bearfield"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3289292","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"When designing simple bar charts depicting the revenue of two companies A and B in two regions East and West, one can group the bars spatially by company such that West A and East A are closer together, and West B and East B are close together.

At present, we lack tools and language for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g., infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains (biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science. This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex scientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory tool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on a spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual metaphors.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"email":"hana.pokojna@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hana Pokojn\u00e1"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Orsay, France","Inria, Saclay, France"],"email":"tobias.isenberg@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":["University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"email":"stefan.bruckner@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stefan Bruckner"},{"affiliations":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"email":"kozlikova@fi.muni.cz","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barbora Kozlikova"},{"affiliations":["University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"email":"laura.garrison@uib.no","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Laura Garrison"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1316/v-full-1316_Preview.mp4?token=aom1JV67M5JX6eNDgcArCWIG3btpoAxnO5PPvGZrCZI&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Hana Pokojn\u00e1"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"image_VisualMetaphors This image illustrates our process (from left to right) for identifying and classifying visual conceptual metaphors in scientific infographics: 1) deconstruct a given infographic to its component graphics, 2) identify component graphics as visual conceptual metaphors versus visual abstractions, 3) classify the conceptual metaphor type (structural, ontological, orientational, or imagistic), and 4) provide infographic metadata and classify the spatiotemporal scale of the phenomenon visualized to enable detailed investigation in our Visual Exploratory Tool.

To address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws through the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and categorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur. Specifically, we analyzed 2227 flawed data visualizations collected from an online gallery and derived a design task-associated taxonomy containing 76 specific design flaws. These flaws were further classified into three high-level categories (i.e., misinformation, uninformativeness, unsociability) and ten subcategories (e.g., inaccuracy, unfairness, ambiguity). Next, we organized five focus groups to explore why these design flaws occur and identified seven causes of the flaws.

In this work, we ask how interactive visualization can benefit PB by conducting a design probe-based interview study (N=13) with policy workers and academics with expertise in PB, urban planning, and civic HCI. Our probe explores how graphical elicitation of voter preferences and a dashboard of voting statistics can be incorporated into a realistic PB tool. Through qualitative analysis, we find that visualization creates opportunities for city government to set expectations about budget constraints while also granting their constituents greater freedom to articulate a wider range of preferences. However, using visualization to provide transparency about PB requires efforts to mitigate potential access barriers and mistrust.

From early infographics to recent data-driven storytelling, visualization has become an integrated part of contemporary journalism, primarily as a communication artifact to inform the general public. Data journalism, harnessing the power of data visualization, has emerged as a bridge between the growing volume of data and our society. Visualization research that centers around data storytelling has sought to understand and facilitate such journalistic endeavors. However, a recent metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and thus broaden visualization research's scope and practical contribution to this evolving field.

Recent research on the persuasive appeal of data visualizations suggests that prior attitudes can be notoriously difficult to change. Inspired by an NYT article, we designed two experiments to evaluate the impact of elicitation and contrasting narratives on attitude change, recall, and engagement. We hypothesized that eliciting prior beliefs leads to more elaborative thinking that ultimately results in higher attitude change, better recall, and engagement. Our findings revealed that visual elicitation leads to higher engagement in terms of feelings of surprise. While there is an overall attitude change across all experiment conditions, we did not observe a significant effect of belief elicitation on attitude change. With regard to recall error, while participants in the draw trend elicitation exhibited significantly lower recall error than participants in the categorize trend condition, we found no significant difference in recall error when comparing elicitation conditions to no elicitation. In a follow-up study, we added contrasting narratives with the purpose of making the main visualization (communicating data on the focal issue) appear strikingly different. Compared to the results of Study 1, we found that contrasting narratives improved engagement in terms of surprise and interest but interestingly resulted in higher recall error and no significant change in attitude. We discuss the effects of elicitation and contrasting narratives in the context of topic involvement and the strengths of temporal trends encoded in the data visualization.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Milad Rogha"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Subham Sah"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alireza Karduni"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Douglas Markant"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wenwen Dou"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243355884/v-tvcg-20243355884_Preview.mp4?token=nw4kl_fRHfxOfS0H7UuBVjdlxGqlCmM-pK__biskZ4I&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243355884/v-tvcg-20243355884_Preview.srt?token=JEfeNpbl8wrsDFdI5umzIeceGgHcse6UJpJmkBCfq0A&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Milad Rogha"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3355884","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Data visualizations in news articles not only inform but also play a crucial role in shaping public opinion on important issues.

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jykim@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jaeyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"sihyeon@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sihyeon Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliations":["Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"gooday19@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Keon-Joo Lee"},{"affiliations":["Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin-si, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"bkim@hufs.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bohyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"braindoc@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"HEE JOON"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1121/v-full-1121_Preview.mp4?token=lSkRirWnWHhBzgGO2eXgj7s4VeGJqJXdwF--jEY_GC8&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1121/v-full-1121_Preview.srt?token=hwvYBVFbHn0wLpZURC3KYGxqDt__oD8g1j19mCZQKZk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Jaeyoung Kim"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"PhenoFlow empowers neurologists to explore large and complex stroke datasets with reduced cognitive load.

Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation. In the context of text summarization, our workflow advocates evaluation with summary characteristics (feature metrics) such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements for text summarization through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the xeffectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation of summarization prompts, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks.

However, prioritizing expressiveness often impedes the learnability of the authoring interface. The diversity of users, such as varying computational skills and prior experiences in user interfaces, makes it even more challenging for a single authoring interface to satisfy the needs of a broad audience. In this paper, we introduce a framework to balance learnability and expressivity in a visualization authoring system. Adopting insights from learnability studies, such as multimodal interaction and visualization literacy, we explore the design space of blending multiple visualization authoring interfaces for supporting authoring tasks in a complementary and flexible manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of blending interfaces, we implemented a proof-of-concept system, Blace, that combines four common visualization authoring interfaces\u2014template-based, shelf configuration, natural language, and code editor\u2014that are tightly linked to one another to help users easily relate unfamiliar interfaces to more familiar ones. Using the system, we conducted a user study with 12 domain experts who regularly visualize genomics data as part of their analysis workflow. Participants with varied visualization and programming backgrounds were able to successfully reproduce unfamiliar visualization examples without a guided tutorial in the study. Feedback from a post-study qualitative questionnaire further suggests that blending interfaces enabled participants to learn the system easily and assisted them in confidently editing unfamiliar visualization grammar in the code editor, enabling expressive customization. Reflecting on our study results and the design of our system, we discuss the different interaction patterns that we identified and design implications for blending visualization authoring interfaces.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"sehi_lyi@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sehi L'Yi"},{"affiliations":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"email":"a.v.d.brandt@tue.nl","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Astrid van den Brandt"},{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"etowah_adams@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Etowah Adams"},{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"huyen_nguyen@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huyen N.

One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users' natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuan Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Weiwei Cui"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dazhen Deng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xinjing Yi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yurun Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haidong Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243368621/v-tvcg-20243368621_Preview.mp4?token=NNF1tI9DBJHzeUfhANxgTkE_e5Wdnhf03qWc96g5uIc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243368621/v-tvcg-20243368621_Preview.srt?token=JSh5JMzUk880YDcFVfesTjDI-6QZABZFEW1cy5mL7Ps&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yuan Tian"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3368621","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"ChartGPT overview.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks.

We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggled to generate semantically diverse and factually accurate takeaways. In Experiment 2, we used the optimal configurations to generate 30 chart takeaways each for eight visualizations across four layouts and two datasets in both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to human takeaways, we found that the takeaways LLMs generated often did not match the types of comparisons made by humans. In Experiment 3, we examined the effect of chart context and data on LLM takeaways. We found that LLMs, unlike humans, exhibited variation in takeaway comparison types for different bar charts using the same bar layout.

In structural biology, this process is necessary to semi-automatically composite large mesoscale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. The current approaches require manual fitting in three dimensions to start, resulting in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. The DiffFit approach enables domain scientists to fit new structures automatically and visualize the results for inspection and interactive revision. The fitting begins with differentiable three-dimensional (3D) rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates followed by sampling the density values at the atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we proposed a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. This loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring the fitting accuracy and an improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found it to be superior to that of previous methods.

Finally, the actual in-silico insertion of the loop candidates from one protein to the other is performed, and the results are visually presented to the user. In this way, the fully computational rational design of proteins and their loops results in newly designed protein structures that can be further assembled and tested through in-vitro experiments.

By analyzing cellular interactions, biomedical experts can gain a more accurate understanding of the intricate relationships between cancer and immune cells. Recent methods have focused on inferring interaction based on the proximity of cells in low-resolution 2D multi-channel imaging data. By contrast, we analyze cell interactions by quantifying the presence and levels of specific proteins within a tissue sample (protein expressions) extracted from high-resolution 3D multi-channel volume data. Such analyses have a strong exploratory nature and require a tight integration of domain experts in the analysis loop to leverage their deep knowledge. We propose two complementary semi-automated approaches to cope with the increasing size and complexity of the data interactively: On the one hand, we interpret cell-to-cell interactions as edges in a cell graph and analyze the image signal (protein expressions) along those edges, using spatial as well as abstract visualizations. Complementary, we propose a cell-centered approach, enabling scientists to visually analyze polarized distributions of proteins in three dimensions, which also captures neighboring cells with biochemical and cell biological consequences. We evaluate our application in three case studies, where biologists and medical experts use \\tool to investigate tumor micro-environments to identify and quantify T-cell activation in human tissue data.

Such a development comes at the cost of increased demands on throughput in genomic data analysis. In this paper, we use the task of copy number variant (CNV) analysis as a context for exploring visualization concepts for clinical genomics. CNV calls are generated algorithmically, but time-consuming manual intervention is needed to separate relevant findings from irrelevant ones in the resulting large call candidate lists. We present a visualization environment, named Copycat, to support this review task in a clinical scenario.Key components are a scatter-glyph plot replacing the traditional list visualization, and a glyph representation designed for at-a-glance relevance assessments.

Our method is tailored for scenes, which are procedurally constructed, based on a given set of building rules. Rendering of large scenes normally requires the entire scene available in-core, or alternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory hierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory management, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly. The key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction strategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is available in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is populated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire scene. Most of the grid cells are not filled with geometry, only those are populated that are potentially seen by the camera. The atomistic detail is populated in a compute shader and its representation is connected with acceleration data structures for hardware ray-tracing of modern GPUs. Objects which are far away, where atomistic detail is not perceivable from a given viewpoint, are represented by a triangle mesh mapped with a seamless texture, generated from the rendering of geometry from atomistic detail. The algorithm consists of two pipelines, the construction-compute pipeline, and the rendering pipeline, which work together to render molecular scenes at an atomistic resolution far beyond the limit of the GPU memory containing trillions of atoms. We demonstrate our technique on multiple models of SARS-CoV-2 and the red blood cell.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ruwayda Alharbi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ond\u02c7rej Strnad"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Klein"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ivan Viola"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243411786/v-tvcg-20243411786_Preview.mp4?token=Sfz1lUTn5a3NOZ0Ph_-sj5NUxB6j2ZFi0aFaci4A1-8&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243411786/v-tvcg-20243411786_Preview.srt?token=qaKnYH41-gSfCdIe9N907yzyt99YIX9TAQx23ahNJIo&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Ruwayda Alharbi"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3411786","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Several populated SARS-CoV-2 virions over Red blood cell particles.

In traditional screen-based visualisations, focus-and-context techniques allow visualisation users to keep a full dataset in view while making detailed selections. Such techniques have been studied extensively on desktop to allow precise selection within large data sets, but they have not been explored in immersive 3D modalities. In this paper we develop a novel immersive focus-and-context technique based on a ``magic portal'' metaphor adapted specifically for data visualisation scenarios. An extendable-hand interaction technique is used to place a portal close to the region of interest.The other end of the portal then opens comfortably within the user's physical reach such that they can reach through to precisely select individual data points.Through a controlled study with 12 participants, we find strong evidence that portals reduce overshoots in selection and overall hand trajectory length, reducing arm and shoulder fatigue compared to ranged interaction without the portal.The portals also enable us to use a robot arm to provide haptic feedback for data within the limited volume of the portal region. In a second study with another 12 participants we found that haptics provided a positive experience (qualitative feedback) but did not significantly reduce fatigue. We demonstrate applications for portal-based selection through two use-case scenarios.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"dai.shaozhang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shaozhang Dai"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"yi.li5@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yi Li"},{"affiliations":["The University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus), Kelowna, Canada"],"email":"barrett.ens@ubc.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barrett Ens"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"lonni.besancon@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lonni Besan\u00e7on"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"tgdwyer@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tim Dwyer"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1699/v-full-1699_Preview.mp4?token=wT8OvZyLiVvdKlORk7nzC3ZNKxJnACWjffJwJAYdzQU&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1699/v-full-1699_Preview.srt?token=qiiiLObmOmzdMBa6T5PyiZm9r3DRn9EQAmrxulLxlZs&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Lonni Besan\u00e7on"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Magic Portal for data selection.

The potential of augmented reality (AR) to integrate digital information into the physical world provides new opportunities for visualizing and interpreting scientific data. However, a limitation of OST-HMD technology is that rendered pixels of a virtual object can interfere with the colors of the real-world, making it challenging to perceive the augmented virtual information accurately. We address this challenge in a two-step approach. First, VoxAR determines an appropriate placement of the volume-rendered object in the real-world scene by evaluating a set of spatial and environmental objectives, managed as user-selected preferences and pre-defined constraints. We achieve a real-time solution by implementing the objectives using a GPU shader language.Next, VoxAR adjusts the colors of the input transfer function (TF) based on the real-world placement region. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization method that adjusts the TF colors such that the resulting volume-rendered pixels are discernible against the background and the TF maintains the perceptual mapping between the colors and data intensity values.

This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"ktang2@nd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1391/v-full-1391_Preview.mp4?token=ITGmgaQ31HqudY__3ys3icjyOy8ieyvto0Z2lDmm_8A&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Kaiyuan Tang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"StyleRF-VolVis is an innovative style transfer framework based on the neural radiance field for expressive volume visualization.

As SRNs are black-box lossy data representations, assessing the prediction quality is critical for scientific visualization applications to ensure that scientists can trust the information being visualized. Currently, existing architectures do not support inference time reconstruction quality assessment, as coordinate-level errors cannot be evaluated in the absence of ground truth data. By employing the uncertain neural network architecture in feature grid SRNs, we obtain prediction variances during inference time to facilitate confidence-aware data reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-decoder SRN (MDSRN) architecture consisting of a shared feature grid with multiple lightweight multi-layer perceptron decoders. MDSRN can generate a set of plausible predictions for a given input coordinate to compute the mean as the prediction of the multi-decoder ensemble and the variance as a confidence score. The coordinate-level variance can be rendered along with the data to inform the reconstruction quality, or be integrated into uncertainty-aware volume visualization algorithms. To prevent the misalignment between the quantified variance and the prediction quality, we propose a novel variance regularization loss for ensemble learning that promotes the Regularized multi-decoder SRN (RMDSRN) to obtain a more reliable variance that correlates closely to the true model error. We comprehensively evaluate the quality of variance quantification and data reconstruction of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Mean Field Variational Inference (MFVI), Deep Ensemble (DE), and Predicting Variance (PV) in comparison with our proposed MDSRN and RMDSRN applied to state-of-the-art feature grid SRNs across diverse scalar field datasets.

Without any prior knowledge about the spatial distribution of values, we are forced to sample densely from INRs to perform visualization tasks like iso-surface extraction which can be very computationally expensive. Recently, range analysis has shown promising results in improving the efficiency of geometric queries, such as ray casting and hierarchical mesh extraction, on INRs for 3D geometries by using arithmetic rules to bound the output range of the network within a spatial region. However, the analysis bounds are often too conservative for complex scientific data. In this paper, we present an improved technique for range analysis by revisiting the arithmetic rules and analyzing the probability distribution of the network output within a spatial region. We model this distribution efficiently as a Gaussian distribution by applying the central limit theorem. Excluding low probability values, we are able to tighten the output bounds, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the value range, and hence more accurate identification of iso-surface cells and more efficient iso-surface extraction on INRs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of the iso-surface extraction time on four datasets compared to the original range analysis method and can also be generalized to other geometric query tasks.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Haoyu Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243365089/v-tvcg-20243365089_Preview.mp4?token=YSsQqjdhLKylaN5IeHQC47JZTglIl1_TAOSsSfKkdvc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243365089/v-tvcg-20243365089_Preview.srt?token=phWo3Qr_Bff0OgzJr7-XKTgDhv37s7bU3np7TbOOGmg&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Haoyu Li"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3365089","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This image shows the iso-surface extraction results comparison between our approach on the right and the traditional approach on the left.

There are a few existing methods that attempt to develop a flexible solution for optimizing different aesthetic aspects measured by different aesthetic criteria. Furthermore, thanks to the significant advance in deep learning techniques, several deep learning-based layout methods were proposed recently, which have demonstrated the advantages of the deep learning approaches for graph drawing. However, none of these existing methods can be directly applied to optimizing non-differentiable criteria without special accommodation. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning framework for graph drawing, called SmartGD, which can optimize any quantitative aesthetic goals even though they are non-differentiable. In the cases where the aesthetic goal is too abstract to be described mathematically, SmartGD can draw graphs in a similar style as a collection of good layout examples, which might be selected by humans based on the abstract aesthetic goal. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartGD, we conduct experiments on minimizing stress, minimizing edge crossing, maximizing crossing angle, and a combination of multiple aesthetics. Compared with several popular graph drawing algorithms, the experimental results show that SmartGD achieves good performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xiaoqi Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kevin Yen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yifan Hu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233306356/v-tvcg-20233306356_Preview.mp4?token=4FeNN97BbtmlhvsZMB10GJ5NdeysTGNjtZGcEi2MjHk&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233306356/v-tvcg-20233306356_Preview.srt?token=e0TXzPdvcYtaKAftmwaAOpQueUFI2YNUVbmpC3fSPn8&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Xiaoqi Wang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3306356","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"SmartGD is a novel deep-learning framework for graph drawing, which can optimize any quantitative aesthetics.

Authoring such an onboarding experience is time-consuming and requires significant knowledge and little guidance on how best to complete this task. Depending on their levels of expertise, end users being onboarded to a new dashboard can be either confused and overwhelmed or disinterested and disengaged. We propose interactive dashboard tours (D-Tours) as semi-automated onboarding experiences that preserve the agency of users with various levels of expertise to keep them interested and engaged. Our interactive tours concept draws from open-world game design to give the user freedom in choosing their path through onboarding. We have implemented the concept in a tool called D-TOUR PROTOTYPE, which allows authors to craft custom interactive dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically generated tours can still be customized to use different media (e.g., video, audio, and highlighting) or new narratives to produce an onboarding experience tailored to an individual user. We demonstrate the usefulness of interactive dashboard tours through use cases and expert interviews. Our evaluation shows that authors found the automation in the D-Tour Prototype helpful and time-saving, and users found the created tours engaging and intuitive.

There is an increasing trend in leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve an end-to-end visualization recommendation. However, existing ML-based approaches implicitly assume that there is only one appropriate visualization for a specific dataset, which is often not true for real applications. Also, they often work like a black box, and are difficult for users to understand the reasons for recommending specific visualizations. To fill the research gap, we propose AdaVis, an adaptive and explainable approach to recommend one or multiple appropriate visualizations for a tabular dataset. It leverages a box embedding-based knowledge graph to well model the possible one-to-many mapping relations among different entities (i.e., data features, dataset columns, datasets, and visualization choices). The embeddings of the entities and relations can be learned from dataset-visualization pairs. Also, AdaVis incorporates the attention mechanism into the inference framework. Attention can indicate the relative importance of data features for a dataset and provide fine-grained explainability. Our extensive evaluations through quantitative metric evaluations, case studies, and user interviews demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaVis.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Songheng Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yong Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haotian Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233316469/v-tvcg-20233316469_Preview.mp4?token=wCwBEW6oJAqCGaF_7k5HslvCKP45i5gj1POdYH9qKtc&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233316469/v-tvcg-20233316469_Preview.srt?token=djcHDOkGOsLAPdzbvC_3CO12Lcv1PjuJHjIGl_j0bV4&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Songheng Zhang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3316469","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"The figures show four pairs of visualizations recommended for four different datasets.

To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan.

Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system.

Such an optimization is governed by multiple, conflicting objectives and it is performed across a multi-dimensional parameter space.The extent of the parameter space, the complexity of the non-linear model of the system,as well as the time needed per simulation run and factors that are not modeled in the simulation necessitate an iterative, semi-automatic approach. We present an interactive visual optimization approach, where the user works with a p-h diagram to steer an iterative, guided optimization process. A deep learning (DL) model provides estimates for parameters, given a target characterization of the system, while numerical simulation is used to compute system characteristics for an ensemble of parameter sets. Since the DL model only serves as an approximation of the inverse of the cooling system and since target characteristics can be chosen according to different, competing objectives, an iterative optimization process is realized, developing multiple sets of intermediate solutions, which are visually related to each other.The standard p-h diagram, integrated interactively in this approach, is complemented by a dual, also interactive visual representation of additional expressive measures representing the system characteristics. We show how the known four-points semantic of the p-h diagram meaningfully transfers to the dual data representation.When evaluating this approach in the automotive domain, we found that our solution helped with the overall comprehension of the cooling system and that it lead to a faster convergence during optimization.

To fill this research gap, we propose QuantumEyes, an interactive visual analytics system to enhance the interpretability of quantum circuits through both global and local levels. For the global-level analysis, we present three coupled visualizations to delineate the changes of quantum states and the underlying reasons: a Probability Summary View to overview the probability evolution of quantum states; a State Evolution View to enable an in-depth analysis of the influence of quantum gates on the quantum states; a Gate Explanation View to show the individual qubit states and facilitate a better understanding of the effect of quantum gates. For the local-level analysis, we design a novel geometrical visualization dandelion chart to explicitly reveal how the quantum amplitudes affect the probability of the quantum state. We thoroughly evaluated QuantumEyes as well as the novel dandelion chart integrated into it through two case studies on different types of quantum algorithms and in-depth expert interviews with 12 domain experts.

We consider an alternative setup where the domain experts take the lead in the design study, supported by the visualization experts. In this study, the domain experts are computer architecture experts who simulate and analyze novel computer chip designs. These chips rely on a Network-on-Chip (NOC) to connect components. The experts want to understand how the chip designs perform and what in the design led to their performance. To aid this analysis, we develop Vis4Mesh, a visualization system that provides spatial, temporal, and architectural context to simulated NOC behavior. Integration with an existing computer architecture visualization tool enables architects to perform deep-dives into specific architecture component behavior. We validate Vis4Mesh through a case study and a user study with computer architecture researchers.

Our domain scientists are going beyond traditional methods by employing both X-ray and neutron computed tomography to obtain complementary representations expected to better resolve material boundaries. However, the use of two modalities creates its own challenges for visualization, requiring either complex adjustments of multimodal transfer functions or the need for multiple views. Together with experts in nondestructive evaluation, we designed a novel interactive multimodal visualization approach to create a combined view of the co-registered X-ray and neutron acquisitions of industrial objects. Using an automatic topological segmentation of the bivariate histogram of X-ray and neutron values as a starting point, the system provides a simple yet effective interface to easily create, explore, and adjust a multimodal isualization. We propose a widget with simple brushing interactions that enables the user to quickly correct the segmented histogram results. Our semiautomated system enables domain experts to intuitively explore large multimodal datasets without the need for either advanced segmentation algorithms or knowledge of visualization echniques. We demonstrate our approach using synthetic examples, industrial phantom objects created to stress multimodal scanning techniques, and real-world objects, and we discuss expert feedback.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huang, Xuan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Miao, Haichao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kim, Hyojin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Townsend, Andrew"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Champley, Kyle"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tringe, Joseph"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pascucci, Valerio"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bremer, Peer-Timo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243382607/v-tvcg-20243382607_Preview.mp4?token=tXtWD-Fz0i8u7eIfUdgouiGgwZ7L-nJDcmSmrOsmXGY&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243382607/v-tvcg-20243382607_Preview.srt?token=aqpJ-RnPiFguRY97IwuBpLjy2Yk82W6DC49AwGefdOI&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Xuan Huang"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3382607","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"The X-Ray and neutron computed tomography industrial object XR05, consisting of multiple materials and intrinsic structures.

In this paper, we investigate factors that contribute to causal relationships users perceive in visualizations. We collected a corpus of concept pairs from variables in widely used datasets and created visualizations that depict varying correlative associations using three typical statistical chart types. We conducted two MTurk studies on (1) preconceived notions on causal relations without charts, and (2) perceived causal relations with charts, for each concept pair. Our results indicate that people make assumptions about causal relationships between pairs of concepts even without seeing any visualized data. Moreover, our results suggest that these assumptions constitute causal priors that, in combination with visualized association, impact how data visualizations are interpreted. The results also suggest that causal priors may lead to over- or under-estimation in perceived causal relations in different circumstances, and that those priors can also impact users' confidence in their causal assessments. In addition, our results align with prior work, indicating that chart type may also affect causal inference. Using data from the studies, we develop a model to capture the interaction between causal priors and visualized associations as they combine to impact a user's perceived causal relations. In addition to reporting the study results and analyses, we provide an open dataset of causal priors for 56 specific concept pairs that can serve as a potential benchmark for future studies.

Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic.

However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality.

Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms \u201c judgment \u201d and \u201c decision making \u201d are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence people's judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.

A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison, including tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in model behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To support real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual system called Compress and Compare. Within a single interface, Compress and Compare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced behavior changes by comparing models\u2019 predictions, weights, and activations. We demonstrate how Compress and Compare supports common compression analysis tasks through two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language models and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models. We further evaluate Compress and Compare in a user study with eight compression experts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression workflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage thorough analysis of compression\u2019s effect on model behavior. Through these evaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual analytics tools should consider and Compress and Compare visualizations that may generalize to broader model comparison tasks.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"aboggust@mit.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Angie Boggust"},{"affiliations":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"vsivaram@andrew.cmu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Venkatesh Sivaraman"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"yassogba@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yannick Assogba"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Seattle, United States"],"email":"donghao@apple.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Donghao Ren"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Pittsburgh, United States"],"email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliations":["Apple, Seattle, United States"],"email":"fred.hohman@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fred Hohman"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1142/v-full-1142_Preview.mp4?token=7bLX7TtYd-7Di9wJoeHtOTxkKehZFEDVJj3D4r93Uoo&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1142/v-full-1142_Preview.srt?token=sApfAyEMxtKgQ5SzPXgHjhpIke2I3KKtKRVsbusIKtk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Angie Boggust"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Compress and Compare helps ML practitioners analyze and compare compression experiments.

While advancements have been made in computational efficiency as well as diversity and convergence of solutions, a critical challenge persists: the internal evolutionary mechanisms are opaque to human users. Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex algorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying evolutionary operators and population dynamics within MOEAs aligns well with a visual analytics paradigm. This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs. Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations. In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"zhangzr32021@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zherui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"yangf2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fan Yang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"ranchengcn@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ran Cheng"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"mayx@sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuxin Ma"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1179/v-full-1179_Preview.mp4?token=HiWFcD9cnvwRDeNVeu8K30udpLarCgMmf95DedtPB38&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fan Yang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We introduce ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to illustrate the dynamics of population generations within evolutionary processes of MOEAs, which consists of three main components: Performance Overview and Generation Statistics (A) Visual Exploration of Individuals among Generations (B) In-depth Visual Inspection of Operators (C).","keywords":["Visual analytics, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, evolutionary computation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/VIS-SUSTech/ParetoTracker","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, external","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04539","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full21","slot_id":"v-full-1179","time_end":"2024-10-17T13:42:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T13:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T13:30:00Z","title":"ParetoTracker: Understanding Population Dynamics in Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms through Visual Analytics","uid":"v-full-1179","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"Providing effective guidance for users has long been an important and challenging task for efficient exploratory visual analytics, especially when selecting variables for visualization in high-dimensional datasets.

Our technique aims to capitalize on the benefits of counterfactual approaches while reducing their complexity for users. We integrated counterfactual guidance into an exploratory visual analytics system, and using a synthetically generated ground-truth causal dataset, conducted a comparative user study and evaluated to what extent counterfactual guidance can help lead users to more precise visual causal inferences. The results suggest that counterfactual guidance improved visual causal inference performance, and also led to different exploratory behaviors compared to correlation-based guidance.

Based on a confocal microscopy dataset, traditionally biologists manually constructed the cell lineage, starting from this observation and reasoning backward in time to establish their inheritance. To speed up this tedious process, we make use of machine learning (ML) models trained on a database of manually established cell lineages to assist the biologist in cell assignment. Most biologists, however, are not familiar with ML, nor is it clear to them which model best predicts the embryo's development. We thus have developed a visualization system that is designed to support biologists in exploring and comparing ML models, checking the model predictions, detecting possible ML model mistakes, and deciding on the most likely embryo development. To evaluate our proposed system, we deployed our interface with six biologists in an observational study. Our results show that the visual representations of machine learning are easily understandable, and our tool, LineageD+, could potentially increase biologists' working efficiency and enhance the understanding of embryos.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jiayi Hong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ross Maciejewski"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alain Trubuil"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233302308/v-tvcg-20233302308_Preview.mp4?token=RobmTzM0OBSW6v7647_8RCVKa3CfNSnTAxYRFWKOzO0&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233302308/v-tvcg-20233302308_Preview.srt?token=5D89AFZIBjrJvDk3bMTaK7lAJV1HGylEQCaJuUcqiKk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Jiayi Hong"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3302308","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"In this paper, we examine the human-AI interaction within the context of plant embryo lineage analysis.

The use of interactive touchscreen exhibits in informal learning environments, such as museums and science centers, often incorporate frameworks that classify learning processes, such as Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, to achieve better user engagement and knowledge transfer. To analyze user behavior within these digital environments, interaction logs are recorded to capture diverse exploration strategies. However, analysis of such logs is challenging, especially in terms of coupling interactions and cognitive learning processes, and existing work within learning and educational contexts remains limited. To address these gaps, we develop a visual analytics approach for analyzing interaction logs that supports exploration at the individual user level and multi-user comparison. The approach utilizes algorithmic methods to identify similarities in users' interactions and reveal their exploration strategies. We motivate and illustrate our approach through an application scenario, using event sequences derived from interaction log data in an experimental study conducted with science center visitors from diverse backgrounds and demographics. The study involves 14 users completing tasks of increasing complexity, designed to stimulate different levels of cognitive learning processes. We implement our approach in an interactive visual analytics prototype system, named VISID, and together with domain experts, discover a set of task-solving exploration strategies, such as \"cascading\" and \"nested-loop\", which reflect different levels of learning processes from Bloom's taxonomy. Finally, we discuss the generalizability and scalability of the presented system and the need for further research with data acquired in the wild.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"peilin.yu@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Peilin Yu"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"aida.vitoria@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aida Nordman"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"marta.koc-januchta@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marta M.

Task abstractions can help us go beyond domain-specific details, but existing visualization task abstractions are insufficient for event sequence visual analytics because they primarily focus on multivariate datasets and often overlook automated analytical techniques. To address this gap, we propose a domain-agnostic multi-level task framework for event sequence analytics, derived from an analysis of 58 papers that present event sequence visualization systems. Our framework consists of four levels: objective, intent, strategy, and technique. Overall objectives identify the main goals of analysis. Intents comprises five high-level approaches adopted at each analysis step: augment data, simplify data, configure data, configure visualization, and manage provenance. Each intent is accomplished through a number of strategies, for instance, data simplification can be achieved through aggregation, summarization, or segmentation. Finally, each strategy can be implemented by a set of techniques depending on the input and output components. We further show that each technique can be expressed through a quartet of action-input-output-criteria.

Our two experiments focus on event sequences with a pre-defined, fixed order, and measure task error rates and completion time. The first experiment shows single sequences and assesses the three charts' performance in comparing event duration or gap. The second experiment shows multiple sequences and evaluates how well the charts reveal temporal patterns. The results suggest that when visualizing single fixed-order event sequences, 1) Gantt and extended Gantt charts lead to comparable error rates in the duration-comparing task; 2) Gantt charts exhibit either shorter or equal completion time than extended Gantt charts; 3) both Gantt and extended Gantt charts demonstrate shorter completion times than stringline charts; 4) however, stringline charts outperform the other two charts with fewer errors in the comparing task when event type counts are high. Additionally, when visualizing multiple point-based fixed-order event sequences, stringline charts require less time than Gantt charts for people to find temporal patterns.

First, TSEQs can be large with respect to both the number of sequences and events, often leading to millions of events. Second, domain experts need validated metrics and features to identify interesting patterns.

Finally, domain experts seek to reduce data complexity by data simplification and machine learning support. We present IVESA, a visual analytics approach for TSEQs. It supports the analysis of TSEQs at the granularities of sequences and events, supported with metrics and feature analysis tools.

This paper presents the design and results of the first study to characterize human performance in 3D spatial data analysis tasks across analogous physical and digital visualizations. Participants analyzed continuous spatial elevation data with three visualization modalities: (1) 2D digital visualization; (2) perspective-tracked, stereoscopic \"fishtank\" virtual reality; and (3) 3D printed data physicalization. Their tasks included tracing paths downhill, looking up spatial locations and comparing their relative heights, and identifying and reporting the minimum and maximum heights within certain spatial regions. As hypothesized, in most cases, participants performed the tasks just as well or better in the physical modality (based on time and error metrics).

To understand how BLV people would use and react to a system combining an RTD with a conversational agent, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with 11 BLV participants, where they interacted with line charts, bar charts, and isarithmic maps. Our analysis of participants' interactions led to the identification of nine distinct patterns. We also learned that the choice of modalities depended on the type of task and prior experience with tactile graphics, and that participants strongly preferred the combination of RTD and speech to a single modality. In addition, participants with more tactile experience described how tactile images facilitated a deeper engagement with the data and supported independent interpretation.

To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction, including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof, to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights. As a result, we provide our design suggestions for the cross-reality environment, emphasizing the interaction with diverse visual representations and seamless interaction transitions between 2D and 3D spaces.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"lixiang.zhao17@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lixiang Zhao"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Orsay, France","Inria, Saclay, France"],"email":"tobias.isenberg@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"fuqi.xie20@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fuqi Xie"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"hainingliang@hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hai-Ning Liang"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"lingyun.yu@xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lingyun Yu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1626/v-full-1626_Preview.mp4?token=sK3xgzYvz9vy3e12YjM6EeAlIsksBkwUQRHAkZSg-e0&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1626/v-full-1626_Preview.srt?token=nNi8GNmk5EYUK_KG5cb0-5UOBQf0CamZesLxXXKI1Zo&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Lixiang Zhao"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"SpatialTouch is a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations.

However, the inherent visual nature of the charts creates barriers for people with visual impairments to reap the associated benefits to the same extent as their sighted peers. While extant research has predominantly focused on understanding and addressing these barriers for blind screen reader users, the needs of low-vision screen magnifier users have been largely overlooked. In an interview study, almost all low-vision participants stated that it was challenging to interact with data charts on small screen devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though they could technically \u201csee\u201d the chart content. They ascribed these challenges mainly to the magnification induced loss of visual context that connected data points with each other and also with chart annotations, e.g., axis values. In this paper, we present a method that addresses this problem by automatically transforming charts that are typically non-interactive images into personalizable interactive charts which allow selective viewing of desired data points and preserve visual context as much as possible under screen enlargement. We evaluated our method in a usability study with 26 low-vision participants, who all performed a set of representative chart-related tasks under different study conditions. In the study, we observed that our method significantly improved the usability of charts over both the status quo screen magnifier and a state-of-the-art space compaction-based solution.

While prior research predominantly focuses on the needs of the visually impaired, our survey aims to broaden this scope by investigating accessible data representations across a more inclusive spectrum of disabilities. After conducting a systematic review of 152 accessible data representation papers from ACM and IEEE databases, we found that roughly 78% of existing articles center on vision impairments. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the remaining 22% of papers focused on underrepresented disability communities. We developed categorical dimensions based on accessibility, visualization, and human-computer interaction to classify the papers. These dimensions include the community of focus, issues addressed, contribution type, study methods, participants, data type, visualization type, and data domain. Our work redefines accessible data representations by illustrating their application for disabilities beyond those related to vision.

However, it is still unknown whether and how speech commands can be used in collaboration, and for what tasks. To answer these questions, we developed a functioning prototype that we used as a technology probe. We conducted an in-depth exploratory study with 10 participant pairs to analyze their interaction choices, the interplay between the input modalities, and their collaboration. While touch was the most used modality, we found that participants preferred speech commands for global operations, used them for distant interaction, and that speech interaction contributed to the awareness of the partner\u2019s actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of using speech commands during collaboration was related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Regarding collaboration styles, participants interacted with speech equally often whether they were in loosely or closely coupled collaboration. While the partners stood closer to each other during close collaboration, they did not distance themselves to use speech commands.

To empower students to fully leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT in educational scenarios, understanding students\u2019 interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the absence of datasets focused on student-ChatGPT conversations and the complexities in identifying and analyzing the evolutional interaction patterns within conversations. To address these challenges, we collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master\u2019s level data visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme, grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students\u2019 interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT\u2019s responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors.

To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with two key components: 1) Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2) Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids experts in organizing and comparing predictions and interpretive paths across different granularities, uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. Facilitated by SLInterpreter, this framework ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration.

The framework leverages a large language model to identify word correspondences with gestures.

We assess the effectiveness of our proposed method through a user study, finding that participants preferred our automated interactive documentation over recordings, transcripts, and manual note-taking.

The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration, spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail ``data stories'' are exported in a standard video file format to establish a common baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client, implemented as a plugin.

Then, we examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages, sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return) through data video creation.

We then built VisTellAR, a mobile AR authoring tool, to help amateur video creators embed data visualizations in short-form videos in situ. A two-day user study shows that participants (N=12) successfully created various videos with data visualizations in situ and they confirmed the ease of use and learning. AR pre-stage authoring was useful to assist people in setting up data visualizations in reality with more designs in camera movements and interaction with gestures and physical objects to storytelling.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Wai Tong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kento Shigyo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lin-Ping Yuan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mingming Fan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ting-Chuen Pong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Meng Xia"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243372104/v-tvcg-20243372104_Preview.mp4?token=2PJhSCM9a-82r8KWVB_bvpn5XWzShv6y8d50FAY5m4o&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Wai Tong"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3372104","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"This figure illustrates an authoring process.

It involves designing complex animations, turning written scripts into audio narrations, and synchronizing visual changes with the narrations. This paper presents WonderFlow, an interactive authoring tool, that facilitates narration-centric design of animated data videos. WonderFlow allows authors to easily specify semantic links between text and the corresponding chart elements. Then it automatically generates audio narration by leveraging text-to-speech techniques and aligns the narration with an animation. WonderFlow provides a structure-aware animation library designed to ease chart animation creation, enabling authors to apply pre-designed animation effects to common visualization components. Additionally, authors can preview and refine their data videos within the same system, without having to switch between different creation tools.

Although mostly built with text and numbers, data tables have a spatial layout and often exhibit visual elements meant to facilitate their reading. Surprisingly, there is an empirical knowledge gap on how people read tables and how different visual aids affect people's reading of tables. In this work, we seek to address this vacuum through a controlled study. We asked participants to repeatedly perform four different tasks with four table representation conditions (plain tables, tables with zebra striping, tables with cell background color encoding cell value, and tables with in-cell bars with lengths encoding cell value). We analyzed completion time, error rate, gaze-tracking data, mouse movement and participant preferences. We found that color and bar encodings help for finding maximum values. For a more complex task (comparison of proportional differences) color and bar helped less than zebra striping. We also characterize typical human behavior for the four tasks.

Such context awareness is particularly useful for ubiquitous and immersive analytics where knowing which embedded visualizations the user is looking at can be used to make visualizations react appropriately to the user\u2019s attention: for example, by highlighting data the user has not yet seen. We can separate the approach into three components: (1) measuring the user\u2019s gaze on a visualization and its parts; (2) tracking the user\u2019s attention over time; and (3) reactively modifying the visual representation based on the current attention metric. In this paper, we present two separate implementations of AAV: a 2D data-agnostic method for web-based visualizations that can use an embodied eyetracker to capture the user\u2019s gaze, and a 3D data-aware one that uses the stencil buffer to track the visibility of each individual mark in a visualization. Both methods provide similar mechanisms for accumulating attention over time and changing the appearance of marks in response.

This design decision may be due to the lack of relevance of vertical scaling in normal PDFs. In fact, as long as two normal PDFs have the same means and standard deviations (SDs), they can be scaled to occupy different amounts of vertical space while still remaining statistically identical. Because unfixed PDF height increases as SD decreases, visualization designers may find themselves tempted to vertically shrink low-SD PDFs to avoid occlusion or save white space in their figures. Although irregular vertical scaling has been explored in bar and line charts, the visualization community has yet to investigate how this visual manipulation may affect reader comparisons of PDFs. In this paper, we present two preregistered experiments (n = 600, n = 401) that systematically demonstrate that vertical scaling can lead to misinterpretations of PDFs. We also test visual interventions to mitigate misinterpretation. In some contexts, we find including a y-axis can help reduce this effect. Overall, we find that keeping vertical scaling consistent, and therefore maintaining equal pixel areas under PDF curves, results in the highest likelihood of accurate comparisons. Our findings provide insights into the impact of vertical scaling on PDFs, and reveal the complicated nature of proportional area comparisons.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"racquel.fygenson@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Racquel Fygenson"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lace M.

These limits dictate the maximum information our mind can process at once. We explore the issue of capacity limitation by testing competing theories that describe how the number of frames shown in a display, the scale of the frames, and time constraints impact user performance with small multiples of line charts in an energy grid scenario. In two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 141 and Experiment 2 n = 360) and a follow-up eye-tracking analysis (n=5),we found a linear decline in accuracy with increasing frames across seven tasks, which was not fully explained by differences in frame size, suggesting visual search challenges. Moreover, the studies demonstrate that highlighting specific frames can mitigate some visual search difficulties but, surprisingly, not eliminate them.

The identification and visualization of clusters in graphs enable insight discovery in many application areas, such as life sciences and social sciences. Force-directed graph layouts promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they bring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. At the same time, matrices can effectively show clusters when a suitable row/column ordering is applied, but are less appealing to untrained users not providing an intuitive node-link metaphor. It is thus worth exploring layouts combining the strengths of the node-link metaphor and node ordering. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and `sfdp'.

However, common analytics tasks are multifaceted, encompassing interactions among four key aspects: strength, function, structure, and content. Current node-link visualization designs may fall short, focusing narrowly on certain aspects and neglecting the holistic, dynamic nature of egocentric networks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpreadLine, a novel visualization framework designed to enable the visual exploration of egocentric networks from these four aspects at the microscopic level. Leveraging the intuitive appeal of storyline visualizations, SpreadLine adopts a storyline-based design to represent entities and their evolving relationships. We further encode essential topological information in the layout and condense the contextual information in a metro map metaphor, allowing for a more engaging and effective way to explore temporal and attribute-based information. To guide our work, with a thorough review of pertinent literature, we have distilled a task taxonomy that addresses the analytical needs specific to egocentric network exploration.Acknowledging the diverse analytical requirements of users, SpreadLine offers customizable encodings to enable users to tailor the framework for their tasks.

Well-known representations like node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices offer valuable insights, but their effectiveness relies on the ability to identify patterns in the underlying topological structure. Reordering strategies and layout algorithms play a vital role in the visualization process since the arrangement of nodes, edges, or cells influences the visibility of these patterns. The BioFabric visualization combines elements of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, leveraging the strengths of both, the visual clarity of node-link diagrams and the tabular organization of adjacency matrices.A unique characteristic of BioFabric is the possibility to reorder nodes and edges separately.This raises the question of which combination of layout algorithms best reveals certain patterns. In this paper, we discuss patterns and anti-patterns in BioFabric, such as staircases or escalators, relate them to already established patterns, and propose metrics to evaluate their quality. Based on these quality metrics, we compared combinations of well-established reordering techniques applied to BioFabric with a well-known benchmark data set. Our experiments indicate that the edge order has a stronger influence on revealing patterns than the node layout. The results show that the best combination for revealing staircases is a barycentric node layout, together with an edge order based on node indices and length.Our research contributes a first building block for many promising future research directions, which we also share and discuss.

They are commonly used to display temporal data or hierarchical graphs. Previous research has demonstrated that minimizing edge crossings is the most important criterion to consider when looking to improve the readability of such graphs. While heuristic approaches exist for crossing minimization, we are interested in optimal approaches to the problem that prioritize human readability over computational scalability. We aim to improve the usefulness and applicability of such optimal methods by understanding and improving their scalability to larger graphs. This paper categorizes and evaluates the state-of-the-art linear programming formulations for exact crossing minimization and describes nine new and existing techniques that could plausibly accelerate the optimization algorithm. Through a computational evaluation, we explore each technique's effect on calculation time and how the techniques assist or inhibit one another, allowing researchers and practitioners to adapt them to the characteristics of their graphs. Our best-performing techniques yielded a median improvement of 2.5\u201317x depending on the solver used, giving us the capability to create optimal layouts faster and for larger graphs.

Empirical evidence about performance and preference for different visualization approaches is scattered over different studies, experimental settings, and tasks. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the dynamic network visualization design space in two evaluations. First, a controlled study assessing participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of network structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without the support of standard interaction methods. Second, the best-performing combinations from the first study are enhanced based on participants' feedback and evaluated in a heuristic-based qualitative study with visualization experts on a real-world network. Our results highlight node-link with animation and playback controls as the best-performing combination and the most preferred based on ratings.

Misleading charts can distort the viewer\u2019s perception of data, leading to misinterpretations and decisions based on false information. The development of effective automatic detection methods for misleading charts is an urgent field of research. The recent advancement of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising direction for addressing this challenge. We explored the capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the impact of different prompting strategies on the models\u2019 analyses. We utilized a dataset of misleading charts collected from the internet by prior research and crafted nine distinct prompts, ranging from simple to complex, to test the ability of four different multimodal LLMs in detecting over 21 different chart issues. Through three experiments\u2013from initial exploration to detailed analysis\u2013we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs to identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the scalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the initial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and critical thinking in data interpretation. There is significant potential in employing multimodal LLMs to counter misleading information by supporting critical thinking and enhancing visualization literacy.

For example, researchers of visualization literacy require large, diverse banks of items to conduct studies where the same skill is measured repeatedly on the same participants. Yet, generating a large number of high-quality, diverse items requires significant time and expertise. To address the critical need for a large number of diverse visualization items in education and research, this paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of multiple-choice visualization items. Through an iterative design process, we develop the VILA (Visualization Items Generated by Large LAnguage Models) pipeline, for efficiently generating visualization items that measure people\u2019s ability to accomplish visualization tasks. We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is the VILA bank of \u223c1,100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of the VILA pipeline, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people\u2019s ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; comparing it to the existing VLAT, VILA-VLAT shows moderate to high convergent validity (R = 0.70). Lastly, we discuss the application areas of the VILA pipeline and the VILA bank and provide practical recommendations for their use.

We asked students to verbally walk through their process of making sense of unfamiliar visualizations, and conducted a qualitative analysis of these walkthroughs. Our qualitative analysis found that after taking a visualization course, students engaged with visualizations in more sophisticated ways: they were more likely to exhibit design empathy by thinking critically about the tradeoffs behind why a chart was designed in a particular way, and were better able to deconstruct a chart to make sense of it. We also gave students a quantitative assessment of visualization literacy and found no evidence of scores improving after the class, likely because the test we used focused on a different set of skills than those emphasized in visualization classes. While current measurement instruments for visualization literacy are useful, we propose developing standardized assessments for additional aspects of visualization literacy, such as deconstruction and design empathy.

We introduce an LLM application that supports both text and visual interaction for guiding chart interpretation. Our study with 26 participants revealed that the in-situ support effectively assisted users in interpreting charts and enhanced learning by addressing specific chart-related questions and encouraging further exploration. Visual communication allowed participants to convey their interests straightforwardly, eliminating the need for textual descriptions. However, the LLM assistance led users to engage less with the system, resulting in fewer insights from the visualizations. This suggests that users, particularly those with lower data literacy and motivation, may have over-relied on the LLM agent.

Overall, participants had a positive reaction; designers recognized the benefits of explicitly writing down components of the design and indicated that they would use this approach in future design work.More specifically, two approaches - writing questions and writing conclusions/takeaways - were seen as beneficial across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise mainly for the creation stage.

Thematic maps pose a number of unique challenges for responsiveness, such as inflexible aspect ratios that do not easily adapt to varying screen dimensions, or densely clustered visual elements in urban areas becoming illegible at smaller scales. However, design guidance on how to best address these issues is currently lacking. We conducted design sessions with eight professional designers and developers of web-based thematic maps for information visualization. Participants were asked to redesign a given map for various screen sizes and aspect ratios and to describe their reasoning for when and how they adapted the design. We report general observations of practitioners\u2019 motivations, decision-making processes, and personal design frameworks. We then derive seven challenges commonly encountered in responsive maps, and 17 strategies to address them, such as repositioning elements, segmenting the map, or using alternative visualizations.

While the effects of examples have been studied in other disciplines, such as web design or engineering, the results are not readily applicable to visualization due to inconsistencies in findings and challenges unique to visualization design. Towards bridging this gap, we conduct an exploratory experiment involving 32 data visualization designers focusing on the influence of five factors (timing, quantity, diversity, data topic similarity, and data schema similarity) on objectively measurable design outcomes (e.g., numbers of designs and idea transfers). Our quantitative analysis shows that when examples are introduced after initial brainstorming, designers curate examples with topics less similar to the dataset they are working on and produce more designs with a high variation in visualization components. Also, designers copy more ideas from examples with higher data schema similarities. Our qualitative analysis of participants\u2019 thought processes provides insights into why designers incorporate examples into their designs, revealing potential factors that have not been previously investigated. Finally, we discuss how our results inform how designers may use examples during design ideation as well as future research on quantifying designs and supporting example-based visualization design.

Subsequently, we specify objects, visual marks, properties, and appearance, storing them in a gene. Lastly, we map data onto the flowpath, ensuring suitable morphisms. Alternative designs are created by exchanging values in the gene. For example, designs that share similar traits, are created by making small incremental changes to the gene. Our design methodology fosters the generation of diverse creative concepts, space-filling visualisations, and traditional formats like bar charts, circular plots and pie charts. Through our implementation we showcase the model in action. As an example application, we integrate the output visualisations onto a smartwatch and visualisation dashboards.

Participants reported mind wandering while viewing visualizations from a pre-labeled visualization database and then provided quantitative ratings of trust, engagement, and design quality, along with qualitative descriptions and short-term/long-term recall assessments. Results show that mind wandering negatively affects short-term visualization recall and various post-viewing measures, particularly for visualizations with little text annotation.

Mind wandering also functions as an intermediate process linking visualization design elements topost-viewing measures, influencing how viewers engage with and interpret visual information over time.

Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields. The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions. Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks. In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions. Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software. We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution. First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods. Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support. Second, we accelerate critical point probability computations using a parallel implementation with the VTK-m library, which is platform portable. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of our implementation with the ParaView software system to demonstrate near-real-time results for real datasets.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"tushar.athawale@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tushar M.

In contrast to pre-existing simplification approaches, our method is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our work enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our framework can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing.

One alternative is to represent the vector field using a discrete approach, which constructs a collection of pairs of simplices in the input mesh that satisfies criteria introduced by Forman\u2019s discrete Morse theory. While numerous approaches exist to compute pairs in the restricted case of the gradient of a scalar field, state-of-the-art algorithms for the general case of vector fields require expensive optimization procedures. This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every simplex in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features.

A commonly agreed upon vortex definition remained elusive since a proper vortex core needs to satisfy two hard constraints: it must be objective and Lagrangian. Recent methods on objectivization met the first but not the second constraint, since there was no formal guarantee that the resulting vortex coreline is indeed a pathline of the fluid flow. In this paper, we propose the first vortex core definition that is both objective and Lagrangian. Our approach restricts observer motions to follow along pathlines, which reduces the degrees of freedoms: we only need to optimize for an observer rotation that makes the observed flow as steady as possible. This optimization succeeds along Lagrangian vortex corelines and will result in a non-zero time-partial everywhere else. By performing this optimization at each point of a spatial grid, we obtain a residual scalar field, which we call vortex deviation error. The local minima on the grid serve as seed points for a gradient descent optimization that delivers sub-voxel accurate corelines. The visualization of both 2D and 3D vortex cores is based on the separation of the movement of the vortex core and the swirling flow behavior around it. While the vortex core is represented by a pathline, the swirling motion around it is visualized by streamlines in the correct frame. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several 2D and 3D time-dependent vector fields.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliations":["University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"],"email":"theisel@ovgu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Holger Theisel"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1574/v-full-1574_Preview.mp4?token=1dzHZmqY0ScY43iHcq0r_TadN7TuEBg0fKQ4q1NmftE&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1574/v-full-1574_Preview.srt?token=fVx8Bc3PS0li54gRmGAIQ0fnF-lBMxgiFhzZIe4XS2M&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Tobias G\u00fcnther"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"In this paper, we present the first finite-time approach that extracts objective vortex corelines, which are guaranteed to be pathlines of the underlying flow.

Uncovering ensemble patterns and analyzing individual members is a challenging task that suffers from clutter. Ensemble statistical summarization can alleviate this issue by permitting analyzing ensembles' distributional components like the mean and median, confidence intervals, and outliers. Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular non-parametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas F.

We conducted a qualitative experiment with 13 professional data scientists analyzing two datasets with Jupyter notebooks, collecting a rich dataset of interaction traces and think-aloud utterances. By qualitatively coding participant utterances, we introduce a formalism that describes EDA as a sequence of analysis states, where each state is comprised of either a representation an analyst constructs (e.g., the output of a data frame, an interactive visualization, etc.) or an observation the analyst makes (e.g., about missing data, the relationship between variables, etc.). By applying our formalism to our dataset, we identify that interactive visualizations, on average, lead to earlier and more complex insights about relationships between dataset attributes compared to static visualizations. Moreover, by calculating metrics such as revisit count and representational diversity, we uncover that some representations serve more as \"planning aids\" during EDA rather than tools strictly for hypothesis-answering. We show how these measures help identify other patterns of analysis behavior, such as the \"80-20 rule\", where a small subset of representations drove the majority of observations. Based on these findings, we offer design guidelines for interactive exploratory analysis tooling and reflect on future directions for studying the role that visualizations play in EDA.

However, existing research on script understanding primarily focuses on revealing the process of data transformations, lacking the ability to analyze the potential scope, i.e., the space of script inputs and outputs. Meanwhile, constructing input/output space during script analysis is challenging, as the wrangling scripts could be semantically complex and diverse, and the association between different data objects is intricate. To facilitate data workers in understanding the input and output space of wrangling scripts, we summarize ten types of constraints to express table space and build a mapping between data transformations and these constraints to guide the construction of the input/output for individual transformations. Then, we propose a constraint generation model for integrating table constraints across multiple transformations. Based on the model, we develop Ferry, an interactive system that extracts and visualizes the data constraints describing the input and output space of data wrangling scripts, thereby enabling users to grasp the high-level semantics of complex scripts and locate the origins of faulty data transformations. Besides, Ferry provides example input and output data to assist users in interpreting the extracted constraints and checking and resolving the conflicts between these constraints and any uploaded dataset.

Many of these tools have been designed through collaborations with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. However, the design, implementation, and practical use of these tools still rely on siloed approaches, resulting in bespoke applications that are difficult to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these tools undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts, typically treating them only as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, they lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, they tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers to cross-domain collaboration. To address these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine data preprocessing, management, and visualization stages while tracking the provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse set of usage scenarios targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access. These scenarios use different types of data and domain methodologies to illustrate Curio's flexibility in tackling pressing societal challenges.

Given a graphic input and original label information, how to place labels to meet both geometric and aesthetic requirements is an open challenging problem. Geometry-wise, traditional rule-driven solutions struggle to capture the complex interactions between labels, let alone consider graphical/appearance content. In terms of aesthetics, training/evaluation data ideally require nontrivial effort and expertise in design, thus resulting in a lack of decent datasets for learning-based methods. To address the above challenges, we formulate the task with a graph representation, where nodes correspond to labels and edges to interactions between labels, and treat label placement as a node position prediction problem. With this novel representation, we design a Label Placement Graph Transformer (LPGT) to predict label positions. Specifically, edge-level attention, conditioned on node representations, is introduced to reveal potential relationships between labels. To integrate graphic/image information, we design a feature aligning strategy that extracts deep features for nodes and edges efficiently. Next, to address the dataset issue, we collect commercial illustrations with professionally designed label layouts from household appliance manuals, and annotate them with useful information to create a novel dataset named the Appliance Manual Illustration Labels (AMIL) dataset. In the thorough evaluation on AMIL, our LPGT solution achieves promising label placement performance compared with popular baselines.

While data visualizations are widely discussed in online communities and social media, comments tend to be displayed separately from the visualization and we lack ways to relate these discussions back to the content of the visualization, e.g., to situate comments, explain visual patterns, or question assumptions. In our visualization annotation interface, users can designate areas within the visualization. Discursive patinas are made of overlaid visual marks (anchors), attached to textual comments with category labels, likes, and replies. By coloring and styling the anchors, a meta visualization emerges, showing what and where people comment and annotate the visualization. These patinas show regions of heavy discussions, recent commenting activity, and the distribution of questions, suggestions, or personal stories. We ran workshops with 90 students, domain experts, and visualization researchers to study how people use anchors to discuss visualizations and how patinas influence people's understanding of the discussion. Our results show that discursive patinas improve the ability to navigate discussions and guide people to comments that help understand, contextualize, or scrutinize the visualization. We discuss the potential of anchors and patinas to support discursive engagements, including critical readings of visualizations, design feedback, and feminist approaches to data visualization.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"tobias.kauer@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias Kauer"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"derya.akbaba@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Derya Akbaba"},{"affiliations":["University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"doerk@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marian D\u00f6rk"},{"affiliations":["Inria, Bordeaux, France","University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"bbach@inf.ed.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Benjamin Bach"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1394/v-full-1394_Preview.mp4?token=CBABLCrD8Q-YwP3M7gFn4tKU58vJoBc0VguQ7DYvcRM&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1394/v-full-1394_Preview.srt?token=Aie2P6umyj0_cHVPgHwnqva_Uf-UOJIhrGytP-lXn_o&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Tobias Kauer"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Discursive Patinas present a new technique that visualizes discussions about visualizations, inspired by traces left in the physical world","keywords":["Data Visualization, Discussion, Annotation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"No","paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17994","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"full31","slot_id":"v-full-1394","time_end":"2024-10-17T14:27:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-17T14:15:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-17T14:15:00Z","title":"Discursive Patinas: Anchoring Discussions in Data Visualizations","uid":"v-full-1394","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"Sketching is a common practice among visualization designers, and an approachable entry to visualizations for individuals, but moving from a sketch to a full fledged data visualization often requires throwing away the original sketch recreating it from scratch.

The reweighting relationships between validation samples and training samples are modeled as a bipartite graph. Based on this graph, a validation sample improvement method is developed to improve the quality of validation samples. Since the automatic improvement may not always be perfect, a co-cluster-based bipartite graph visualization is developed to illustrate the reweighting relationships and support the interactive adjustments to validation samples and reweighting results. The adjustments are converted into the constraints of the validation sample improvement method to further improve validation samples.

However, due to point sparsity, lack of structure, irregular distribution, and acquisition-related inaccuracies, results of point cloudvisualization are often subject to visual complexity and ambiguity. In this regard, non-photorealistic rendering can improve visual communication by reducing the cognitive effort required to understand an image or scene and by directing attention to important features. In the last 20 years, this has been demonstrated by various non-photorealistic rrendering approaches that were proposed to target point clouds specifically. However, they do not use a common language or structure for assessment which complicates comparison and selection. Further, recent developments regarding point cloud characteristics and processing, such as massive data size or web-based rendering are rarelyconsidered. To address these issues, we present a survey on non-photorealistic rendering approaches for point cloud visualization, providing an overview of the current state of research. We derive a structure for the assessment of approaches, proposing seven primary dimensions for the categorization regarding intended goals, data requirements, used techniques, and mode of operation.

Such an assistant must be able to perceive the environment and actions, reason about the environment state in relation to a given task, and seamlessly interact with the task performer. These interactions typically involve an AR headset equipped with sensors which capture video, audio, and haptic feedback. Previous works have sought to facilitate the development of intelligent AR assistants by visualizing these sensor data streams in conjunction with the assistant's perception and reasoning model outputs. However, existing visual analytics systems do not focus on user modeling or include biometric data, and are only capable of visualizing a single task session for a single performer at a time. Moreover, they typically assume a task involves linear progression from one step to the next. We propose a visual analytics system that allows users to compare performance during multiple task sessions, focusing on non-linear tasks where different step sequences can lead to success. In particular, we design visualizations for understanding user behavior through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data as a proxy for perception, attention, and memory as well as corresponding motion data (acceleration, angular velocity, and gaze). We distill these insights into embedding representations that allow users to easily select groups of sessions with similar behaviors. We provide two case studies that demonstrate how to use these visualizations to gain insights abouttask performance using data collected during helicopter copilot training tasks.

Yet, creating a progressive visualization requires more effort than a regular visualization but also opens up new possibilities, such as steering the computations towards more relevant parts of the data, thus saving computational resources. However, there is currently no comprehensive overview of the design space for progressive visualization systems. We surveyed the related work of PV and derived a new taxonomy for progressive visualizations by systematically categorizing all PV publications that included visualizations with progressive features. Progressive visualizations can be categorized by well-known visualization taxonomies, but we also found that progressive visualizations can be distinguished by the way they manage their data processing, data domain, and visual update. Furthermore, we identified key properties such as uncertainty, steering, visual stability, and real-time processing that are significantly different with progressive applications.

While several recent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory environments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored, mono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a versatile approach (supporting both triangulated domains and regular grids) for the support of topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct numbers of processes. While developing this extension, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. We describe an MPI extension of TTK\u2019s data structure for triangulation representation and traversal, a central component to the global performance and generality of TTK\u2019s topological implementations. We also introduce an intermediate interface between TTK and MPI, both at the global pipeline level, and at the fine-grain algorithmic level. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from 20% to 80% (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1536 cores). Finally, we provide a roadmap for the completion of TTK\u2019s MPI extension, along with generic recommendations for each algorithm communication category.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"E.

Nonetheless, creating accurately labeled medical texts of high quality is often a time-consuming task that requires specialized domain knowledge. Traditional methods for generating labeled data typically rely on rigid rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to new tasks. While recent machine learning (ML) methodologies have mitigated the manual labeling efforts, configuring models to align with specific research requirements can be challenging for labelers without technical expertise. Moreover, automated labeling techniques, such as transfer learning, face difficulties in in directly incorporating expert input, whereas semi-automated methods, like data programming, allow knowledge integration through rules or knowledge bases but may lack continuous result refinement throughout the entire labeling process. In this study, we present a collaborative human-ML teaming workflow that seamlessly integrates visual cluster analysis and active learning to assist domain experts in labeling medical text with high efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an innovative neural network model called the embedding network, which incorporates expert insights to generate task-specific embeddings for medical texts. We integrate the workflow and embedding network into a visual analytics tool named KMTLabeler, equipped with coordinated multi-level views and interactions. Two illustrative case studies, along with a controlled user study, provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of KMTLabeler in creating an efficient labeling environment for medical text classification.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"He Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Ouyang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuchen Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chang Jiang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lixia Jin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuanwu Cao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Quan Li"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243406387/v-tvcg-20243406387_Preview.mp4?token=VnPRkdepeRVTnH4pmVCk7zBKKkpq42d2mzlaLMT86as&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20243406387/v-tvcg-20243406387_Preview.srt?token=MPFzXxvpYtQoeH-IVkROFZyv0TberWC63x-c_lzzevI&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Quan Li"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3406387","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":" The KMTLabeler interface: The (A) Control Panel provides an overview of the dataset and enables filtering for labeling.

Today's lossy compressors rarely consider preserving topologies such as Morse-Smale complexes, and the discrepancies in topology between original and decompressed datasets could potentially result in erroneous interpretations or even incorrect scientific conclusions. In this paper, we focus on preserving Morse-Smale segmentations in 2D/3D piecewise linear scalar fields, targeting the precise reconstruction of minimum/maximum labels induced by the integral line of each vertex. The key is to derive a series of edits during compression time. These edits are applied to the decompressed data, leading to an accurate reconstruction of segmentations while keeping the error within the prescribed error bound. To this end, we develop a workflow to fix extrema and integral lines alternatively until convergence within finite iterations. We accelerate each workflow component with shared-memory/GPU parallelism to make the performance practical for coupling with compressors. We demonstrate use cases with fluid dynamics, ocean, and cosmology application datasets with a significant acceleration with an NVIDIA A100 GPU.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"li.14025@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuxiao Li"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Riverside, Riverside, United States"],"email":"xlian007@ucr.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xin Liang"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bei Wang"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"qiu.722@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yongfeng Qiu"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"lyan@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lin Yan"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1793/v-full-1793_Preview.mp4?token=mq_GwqVoaX8VM0EBDuKWSvU8zRZEYMCZpPRYlndDs5E&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-full/v-full-1793/v-full-1793_Preview.srt?token=qZnV8L0OVhtE5M8C6zYi7I6Me-QIz-UonlBkWLAHe44&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Yuxiao Li"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This figure compares SZ3 and ours (SZ3) in terms of feature preservation capability for MSS in combustion data.

Several similarity measures for topological descriptors seem to be both asymptotically and practically efficient with polynomial time algorithms, but they do not scale well when handling large-scale, time-varying scientific data and ensembles. In this paper, we propose a new framework to facilitate the comparative analysis of merge trees, inspired by tools from locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH hashes similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability. We propose two new similarity measures for merge trees that can be computed via LSH, using new extensions to Recursive MinHash and subpath signature, respectively. Our similarity measures are extremely efficient to compute and closely resemble the results of existing measures such as merge tree edit distance or geometric interleaving distance. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our LSH framework in applications such as shape matching, clustering, key event detection, and ensemble summarization.

Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed \u201clayering\u201d. Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., \u03bb2), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"adeelz92@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adeel Zafar"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"zpoorsha@cougarnet.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zahra Poorshayegh"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"diyang@uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Di Yang"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"chengu@cs.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoning Chen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1188/v-short-1188_Preview.mp4?token=sgv_irFDfgo2UYspqvHcN4nevlgpkBM3_ckeCMVGAiU&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-short/v-short-1188/v-short-1188_Preview.srt?token=SYeVB_zKh2OueId1Sa6sV8jHchqiMdi7Sb3LdtGw9Yk&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Adeel Zafar"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"This figure illustrates the steps of the proposed topological separation method.

Based on that, we propose an information diffusion model that estimates the likelihood of a topic/post spreading among different social media platforms.

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can improve processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy.

In practice, when viewers are confronted with embedded visualizations, they often have to focus on a primary task and can only quickly glance at a visualization showing rich, often dynamically updated, information. As such, the visualizations must be designed so as not to distract from the primary task, while at the same time being readable and useful for aiding the primary task. For example, in games, players who are engaged in a battle have to look at their enemies but also read the remaining health of their own game character from the health bar over their character's head. Many trade-offs are possible in the design of embedded visualizations in such dynamic scenarios, which we explore in-depth in this paper with a focus on user experience. We use video games as an example of an application context with a rich existing set of visualizations in motion. We begin our work with a systematic review of in-game visualizations in motion.

We derive our insights from analyzing swimming race visualizations and motion-related data, building a technology probe, as well as a study with designers. Understanding how to design situated visualizations in motion is important for a variety of contexts. Competitive sports coverage, in particular, increasingly includes information on athlete or team statistics and records. Although moving visual representations attached to athletes or other targets are starting to appear, systematic investigations on how to best support their design process in the context of sports videos are still missing. Our work makes several contributions in identifying opportunities for visualizations to be added to swimming competition coverage but, most importantly, in identifying requirements and challenges for designing situated visualizations in motion. Our investigations include the analysis of a survey with swimming enthusiasts on their motion-related information needs, an ideation workshop to collect designs and elicit design challenges, the design of a technology probe that allows to create embedded visualizations in motion based on real data, and an evaluation with visualization designers that aimed to understand the benefits of designing directly on videos.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lijie Yao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Romain Vuillemot"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Anastasia Bezerianos"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Petra Isenberg"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233341990/v-tvcg-20233341990_Preview.mp4?token=UhovQpwtoTs04VevSR-D-3grQfz_P_1fjxzRIrcoJvg&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/v-tvcg/v-tvcg-20233341990/v-tvcg-20233341990_Preview.srt?token=06mGz18pkPvSVcT0qmxfzeab_bc7Yvju_kHMUBDGMso&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Lijie Yao"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3341990","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"Embedded representations added to a swimming video of the 2021 French Championship using our technology probe.

Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, SBSS finds latent components in the dataset and is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, when analysts try different tuning parameter settings, the amount of latent components complicates analytical tasks. Based on our years-long collaboration with SBSS researchers, we propose a visualization approach to tackle this challenge.

We describe the UT visualization pipeline and integrate UT into an interactive multiple-view system. We demonstrate its effectiveness through interviews with SBSS experts, a qualitative evaluation with visualization experts, and computational experiments. SBSS experts were excited about our approach. They saw many benefits for their work and potential applications for geostatistical data analysis more generally.

Multi-dimensional partitionings occur, for example, when analyzing parameter spaces of simulation models, where each segment of the partitioning represents a region of similar model behavior. Having computed a partitioning, one is commonly interested in understanding how large the segments are and which segments lie next to each other. While visual representations of 2D domain partitionings that reveal sizes and neighborhoods are straightforward, this is no longer the case when considering multi-dimensional domains of three or more dimensions. We propose an algorithm for computing 2D embeddings of multi-dimensional partitionings. The embedding shall have the following properties: It shall maintain the topology of the partitioning and optimize the area sizes and joint boundary lengths of the embedded segments to match the respective sizes and lengths in the multi-dimensional domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to different use cases, including the visual exploration of 3D spatial domain segmentations and multi-dimensional parameter space partitionings of simulation ensembles. We numerically evaluate our algorithm with respect to how well sizes and lengths are preserved depending on the dimensionality of the domain and the number of segments.

Hyperbolic spaces have proven to be an important tool for embedding computations and analysis tasks as their non-linear nature lends itself well to tree or graph data. Subsequently, they have also been used in the visualization of high-dimensional data, where they exhibit increased embedding performance. However, none of the existing dimensionality reduction methods for embedding into hyperbolic spaces scale well with the size of the input data. That is because the embeddings are computed via iterative optimization schemes and the computation cost of every iteration is quadratic in the size of the input. Furthermore, due to the non-linear nature of hyperbolic spaces, Euclidean acceleration structures cannot directly be translated to the hyperbolic setting. This paper introduces the first acceleration structure for hyperbolic embeddings, building upon a polar quadtree.

Existing methods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the same category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we introduce SimpleSets, which uses simple shapes to enclose categorical point patterns, thereby providing a clean overview of the data distribution. SimpleSets is designed to visualize sets of points with a single categorical attribute; as a result, the point patterns enclosed by SimpleSets form a partition of the data. We give formal definitions of point patterns that correspond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions categorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a rendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of shapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm pays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a consistent manner.

However, prevailing algorithms addressing CSLP are hampered by restrictive assumptions and computational overhead, leading to a dearth of comprehensive evaluations in the spatiotemporal dimensions. Consequently, their practical viability is restricted.

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model\u2019s decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens, a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model\u2019s features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study.

Comparing multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but traditional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework for comparing embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts\u2014confusion, neighborhood, and relative size\u2014to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships.

To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets.

These layouts result from a dimensionality reduction on the document-term matrix or a representation within a latent embedding, including topic models. Thereby, the resulting layout depends on the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction and is therefore affected by changes in them. Furthermore, the resulting layout is affected by changes in the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction. However, such changes to the layout require additional cognitive efforts from the user. In this work, we present a sensitivity study that analyzes the stability of these layouts concerning (1) changes in the text corpora, (2) changes in the hyperparameter, and (3) randomness in the initialization. Our approach has two stages: data measurement and data analysis. First, we derived layouts for the combination of three text corpora and six text embeddings and a grid-search-inspired hyperparameter selection of the dimensionality reductions. Afterward, we quantified the similarity of the layouts through ten metrics, concerning local and global structures and class separation. Second, we analyzed the resulting 42817 tabular data points in a descriptive statistical analysis. From this, we derived guidelines for informed decisions on the layout algorithm and highlight specific hyperparameter settings.

We propose an algorithm that compensates for irregular sample distributions by a smooth transformation of the scatterplot's visual domain. Our algorithm evaluates the scatterplot's density distribution to compute a regularization mapping based on integral images of the rasterized density function. The mapping preserves the samples' neighborhood relations. Few regularization iterations suffice to achieve a nearly uniform sample distribution that efficiently uses the available screen space. We further propose approaches to visually convey the transformation that was applied to the scatterplot and compare them in a user study.

This algorithm bridges the gap in sampling for streaming time series data.

Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) catalyzes haptic interactions on surface visualizations. Various interaction modes, encompassing both mid-air and on-surface interactions---with or without the application of assisting force stimuli---have been explored using haptic force feedback devices. In this paper, we evaluate the use of on-surface and assisted on-surface haptic modes of interaction compared to a no-haptic interaction mode. A force-based haptic stylus is used for all three modalities; the on-surface mode uses collision based forces, whereas the assisted on-surface mode is accompanied by an additional snapping force. We conducted a within-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across all three modes, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took almost the same time to brush curves using all the interaction modes. They could draw smoother curves using the on-surface interaction modes compared to the no-haptic mode. However, the assisted on-surface mode provided better accuracy than the on-surface mode. The on-surface mode was slower in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant feedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share takeaways to aid the design of haptics-based tangible interactions for surface visualizations.

Complex traffic patterns are difficult to predict and manage and impose cognitive load on the air traffic controllers. In this work we present an interactive visual analytics interface which facilitates detection and resolution of complex traffic patterns for air traffic controllers. The interface supports air traffic controllers in detecting complex clusters of aircraft and further enables them to visualize and simultaneously compare how different re-routing strategies for each individual aircraft yield reduction of complexity in the entire sector for the next hour. The development of the concepts was supported by the domain-specific feedback we received from six fully licensed and operational air traffic controllers in an iterative design process over a period of 14 months.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden","Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"elmira.zohrevandi@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Elmira Zohrevandi"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden","Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"katerina.vrotsou@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Katerina Vrotsou"},{"affiliations":["Institute of Science and Technology, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden","Institute of Science and Technology, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"carl.westin@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Carl A.

Prior research has identified five dimensions of trust assessment in visualizations (credibility, clarity, reliability, familiarity, and confidence), and observed that these dimensions tend to vary predictably along with certain features of the visualization being evaluated. This raises a further question: how do the design features driving viewers' trust assessment vary with the characteristics of the viewers themselves? By reanalyzing data from these studies through the lens of individual differences, we build a more detailed map of the relationships between design features, individual characteristics, and trust behaviors. In particular, we model the distinct contributions of endogenous design features (such as visualization type, or the use of color) and exogenous user characteristics (such as visualization literacy), as well as the interactions between them. We then use these findings to make recommendations for individualized and adaptive visualization design.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Smith College, Northampton, United States"],"email":"jcrouser@smith.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"R.

To address this limitation, we present Groot, a prototype system that allows users to proactively specify and refine automated data insights. The system allows users to directly manipulate chart elements to receive insight recommendations based on their selections. Additionally, Groot provides users with a manual editing interface to customize, reconfigure, or add new insights to individual charts and propagate them to future explorations. We describe a usage scenario to illustrate how these features collectively support insight editing and configuration and discuss opportunities for future work, including incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs), improving semantic data and visualization search, and supporting insight management.

However, common statistical tools do not verify users\u2019 decision choices and provide low-level statistical functions without instructions on the whole analysis practice. Users can easily misuse analysis methods, potentially decreasing the validity of results. To address this problem, we introduce GuidedStats, an interactive interface within computational notebooks that encapsulates guidance, models, visualization, and exportable results into interactive workflows.

In this paper, we introduce a set of six strategies for adapting content from business intelligence (BI) dashboards into appropriate formats for sharing on collaboration platforms, formats that we refer to as dashboard snapshots. Informed by prior studies of enterprise communication around data, these strategies go beyond redesigning or restyling by considering varying levels of data literacy across an organization, introducing affordances for self-service question-answering, and anticipating the post-sharing lifecycle of data artifacts. These strategies involve the use of templates that are matched to common communicative intents, serving to reduce the workload of data professionals.

While these approaches provide flexibility, they create a significant barrier to entry for non-experts and obscure the immediate impact of architectural decisions on model performance. In response to this challenge, recent no-code approaches have been developed with the aim of enabling easy model development through graphical interfaces. However, both traditional and no-code methodologies share a common limitation that the inability to predict model outcomes or identify issues without executing the model. To address this limitation, we introduce an intuitive visual feedback-based no-code approach to visualize and analyze deep learning models during the design phase.

Utilizing a dataset of tweet-visualization pairs with various visual misleaders, we tested these models under four experimental conditions with different levels of guidance. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 models can detect misleading visualizations with moderate accuracy without prior training (naive zero-shot) and that performance considerably improves by providing the model with the definitions of misleaders (guided zero-shot). Our results indicate that a single prompt engineering technique does not necessarily yield the best results for all types of misleaders. We found that guided few-shot was more effective for reasoning misleaders, while guided zero-shot performed better for design misleaders.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for lowering barriers for users to achieve tasks such as writing code and may likewise facilitate visualization insight. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a text-based image format common in data visualizations, matches well with the text sequence processing of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we explore the capability of LLMs to perform 10 low-level visual analytic tasks defined by Amar, Eagan, and Stasko directly on SVG-based visualizations. Using zero-shot prompts, we instruct the models to provide responses or modify the SVG code based on given visualizations. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively modify existing SVG visualizations for some tasks like Cluster but perform poorly on tasks requiring mathematical operations like Compute Derived Value. We also discovered that LLM performance can vary based on factors such as the number of data points, the presence of value labels, and the chart type.

In this work, we investigate how such stochasticity affects the stability of projections and present a novel DR technique, GhostUMAP, to measure the pointwise instability of projections. Our idea is to introduce clones of data points, \u201cghosts\u201d, into UMAP\u2019s layout optimization process. Ghosts are designed to be completely passive: they do not affect any others but are influenced by attractive and repulsive forces from the original data points. After a single optimization run, GhostUMAP can capture the projection instability of data points by measuring the variance with the projected positions of their ghosts. We also present a successive halving technique to reduce the computation of GhostUMAP.

In several applications, including biological workflows, chemical equations, and computational data flow analysis, these graphs often exhibit a tree-like nesting structure, where sibling clusters are disjoint. Common compound graph layouts prioritize the lowest level of the grouping, down to the individual ungrouped vertices, which can make the higher level grouped structures more difficult to discern, especially in deeply nested networks. Leveraging the additional structure of the tree-like nesting, we contribute an overview+detail layout for this class of compound graphs that preserves the saliency of the higher level network structure when groups are expanded to show internal nested structure. Our layout draws inner structures adjacent to their parents, using a modified tree layout to place substructures. We describe our algorithm and then present case studies demonstrating the layout's utility to a domain expert working on data flow analysis.

These modes utilize different APIs and exhibit distinct capabilities. Our focus is on direct volume rendering, selected for its implementation challenges due to the native graphics APIs being predominantly oriented towards surface shading. Volume rendering is particularly vital in fields where AR and VR visualizations offer substantial benefits, such as in medicine and manufacturing.

Additionally, they require the field to be smoothed to obtain continuous large-scale structures. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative method to front extraction using ridge surface computation. The proposed method requires only the second derivative of the input field and produces accurate structures even from unsmoothed data.

However, it remains challenging to assess how these models process charts. Existing benchmarks only roughly evaluate model performance without evaluating the underlying mechanisms, such as how models extract image embeddings. This limits our understanding of the model's ability to perceive fundamental graphical components. To address this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework to assess the graphical perception of image embedding models. For chart comprehension, we examine two main aspects of channel effectiveness: accuracy and discriminability of various visual channels. Channel accuracy is assessed through the linearity of embeddings, measuring how well the perceived magnitude aligns with the size of the stimulus. Discriminability is evaluated based on the distances between embeddings, indicating their distinctness. Our experiments with the CLIP model show that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and shows unique discriminability in channels like length, tilt, and curvature.

While prior research has explored this ability in conventional charts, it is unclear if spatial visualizations used by computational scientists afford a similar ensemble perception capacity. We investigate people's ability to estimate two summary statistics, mean and variance, from pseudocolor scalar fields. In a crowdsourced experiment, we find that participants can reliably characterize both statistics, although variance discrimination requires a much stronger signal. Multi-hue and diverging colormaps outperformed monochromatic, luminance ramps in aiding this extraction. Analysis of qualitative responses suggests that participants often estimate the distribution of hotspots and valleys as visual proxies for data statistics. These findings suggest that people's summary interpretation of spatial datasets is likely driven by the appearance of discrete color segments, rather than assessments of overall luminance. Implicit color segmentation in quantitative displays could thus prove more useful than previously assumed by facilitating quick, gist-level judgments about color-coded visualizations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"vmateevitsi@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor A.

Therefore, understanding the composition and distribution of these datasets has become increasingly crucial. To address the need for intuitive exploration of these datasets, we propose AEye, an extensible and scalable visualization tool tailored to image datasets. AEye utilizes a contrastively trained model to embed images into semantically meaningful high-dimensional representations, facilitating data clustering and organization. To visualize the high-dimensional representations, we project them onto a two-dimensional plane and arrange images in layers so users can seamlessly navigate and explore them interactively. AEye facilitates semantic search functionalities for both text and image queries, enabling users to search for content. We open-source the codebase for AEye, and provide a simple configuration to add datasets.

Typically, reconstruction algorithms first identify common features across images and then minimize reconstruction errors after estimating the shape of the terrain. This bundle adjustment (BA) step optimizes around a single, simplifying scalar value that obfuscates many possible causes of reconstruction errors (e.g., initial estimate of the position and orientation of the camera, lighting conditions, ease of feature detection in the terrain). Reconstruction errors can lead to inaccurate scientific inferences or endanger a spacecraft exploring a remote environment. To address this challenge, we present VECTOR, a visual analysis tool that improves error inspection for stereo reconstruction BA. VECTOR provides analysts with previously unavailable visibility into feature locations, camera pose, and computed 3D points.

Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) for data visualization have explored ways to infer such information, yet challenges persist due to inherent uncertainty in human speech. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an avenue to address these challenges, but their ability to extract the relevant semantic information remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four publicly available LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, Llama3, and Mixtral), investigating their ability to comprehend utterances even in the presence of uncertainty and identify the relevant data context and visual tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs are sensitive to uncertainties in utterances. Despite this sensitivity, they are able to extract the relevant data context. However, LLMs struggle with inferring visualization tasks. Based on these results, we highlight future research directions on using LLMs for visualization generation.

Through a case study with 359 bar charts, we test novel fine tuning schemes on both GPT-3 and T5 using a new dataset curated for two CQA tasks: question-answering and visual explanation generation. Our text-only approaches strongly outperform vision-based GPT-4 on explanation generation (99% vs. 63% accuracy), and show promising results for question-answering (57-67% accuracy).

These displays are often multi-purpose, functioning as interfaces for selecting device settings, communicating operating status using simple visualizations, and displaying notifications. However, their usability for people in the late adulthood (PLA) development stage is not well-understood. We report on two focus groups with PLA (n=11, ages 76-94) from a local retirement community. Participants were shown images of everyday home electronics and appliances, answering questions about their experiences using the EIDs.

The most widely used remedy for making data visualizations accessible is text descriptions. Yet, manually creating useful text descriptions is often omitted by visualization authors, either because of a lack of awareness or a perceived burden. Automatically generated text descriptions are a potential partial remedy. However, with current methods it is unfeasible to create text descriptions for complex scientific charts. In this paper, we describe our methods for generating text descriptions for one complex scientific visualization: the UpSet plot. UpSet is a widely used technique for the visualization and analysis of sets and their intersections. At the same time, UpSet is arguably unfamiliar to novices and used mostly in scientific contexts. Generating text descriptions for UpSet plots is challenging because the patterns observed in UpSet plots have not been studied. We first analyze patterns present in dozens of published UpSet plots. We then introduce software that generates text descriptions for UpSet plots based on the patterns present in the chart. Finally, we introduce a web service that generates text descriptions based on a specification of an UpSet plot, and demonstrate its use in both an interactive web-based implementation and a static Python implementation of UpSet.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"ishratjahan.eliza@utah.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ishrat Jahan Eliza"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"jakew@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jake Wagoner"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"jwilburn@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jack Wilburn"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"natelanzadevelopment@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nate Lanza"},{"affiliations":["University College London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"d.hajas@ucl.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Hajas"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"alex@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alexander Lex"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Ishrat Jahan Eliza"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop7","slot_id":"w-accessible-1015","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"Accessible Text Descriptions for UpSet Plots","uid":"w-accessible-1015","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"Many data visualization tools require a mouse.

The evaluation of visualization systems is fundamental to ensuring their effectiveness, usability, and impact. Faithful evaluations provide valuable insights into how users interact with and perceive the system, enabling designers to make informed decisions about design choices and improvements. However, an emerging trend of multiple evaluations within a single study raises critical questions about the sustainability, feasibility, and methodological rigor of such an approach. So, how many evaluations are enough? is a situational question and cannot be formulaically determined. Our objective is to summarize current trends and patterns to understand general practices across different contribution and evaluation types. New researchers and students, influenced by this trend, may believe-- multiple evaluations are necessary for a study. However, the number of evaluations in a study should depend on its contributions and merits, not on the trend of including multiple evaluations to strengthen a paper. In this position paper, we identify this trend through a non-exhaustive literature survey of TVCG papers from issue 1 in 2023 and 2024.

While existing models like the Information Visualization Reference Model describe the data-to-visual mapping process, they often overlook a crucial intermediary step: design-specific transformations. This process, occurring after data transformation but before visual-data mapping, further derives data, such as groupings, layout, and statistics, that are essential to properly render the visualization. In this paper, we advocate for a deeper exploration of design-specific transformations, highlighting their importance in understanding visualization properties, particularly in relation to user tasks. We incorporate design-specific transformations into the Information Visualization Reference Model and propose a new formalism that encompasses the user task as a function over data. The resulting formalism offers three key benefits over existing visualization models: (1) describing tasks as compositions of functions, (2) enabling analysis of data transformations for visual-data mapping, and (3) empowering reasoning about visualization correctness and effectiveness.

Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure the projection\u2019s accuracy or faithfulness to the full data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and other distance-based quality metrics analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations.

In an experiment, we show that metacognitive processes are involved in understanding deceptive bar charts, i.e., that reasoners who are able to reflect on and adjust their strategies can improve their performance even without feedback on the correctness of their answers.","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"https://vcg.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/publications/pubdetails/Schlieder2024metacognition/","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"associated6a","slot_id":"w-beliv-1009","time_end":"2024-10-14T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-14T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-14T12:30:00Z","title":"The Role of Metacognition in Understanding Deceptive Bar Charts","uid":"w-beliv-1009","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"Empirical studies in visualisation often compare visual representations to identify the most effective visualisation for a particular visual judgement or decision making task. However, the effectiveness of a visualisation may be intrinsically related to, and difficult to distinguish from, factors such as visualisation literacy. Complicating matters further, visualisation literacy itself is not a singular intrinsic quality, but can be a result of several distinct challenges that a viewer encounters when performing a task with a visualisation. In this paper, we describe how such challenges apply to experiments that we use to evaluate visualisations, and discuss a set of considerations for designing studies in the future. Finally, we argue that aspects of the study design which are often neglected or overlooked (such as the onboarding of participants, tutorials, training etc.) can have a big role in the results of a study and can potentially impact the conclusions that the researchers can draw from the study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"abhraneel@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Abhraneel Sarma"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"shenglong@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sheng Long"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Portland, United States"],"email":"m.correll@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Correll"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Chicago, United States"],"email":"matthew.kay@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthew Kay"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Abhraneel Sarma"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The 'Telephone' framework describes two possible pathways of participants\u2019 behaviour in experiments.

In policymaking, personal narratives are regarded as an important source of intelligence to shape public discourse andpolicy. Therefore, policymakers are interested in the interplay between individual-level experiences and macro-political processes that play into shaping these experiences. In this context, visualisation is regarded as a medium for advocacy, creating a power balance between individuals and the power structures that influence their health and well-being. In this paper, we offer a politically-framed reflection on how visualisation creators define lived experience data, and what design choices they make for visualising them. We identify data characteristics and design choices that enable visualisation authors and consumers to engage in a process of narrative co-construction, while navigating structural forms of inequality. Our political framing is driven by ideas of master and alternative narratives from Diversity Science, in which authors and narrators engage in a process of negotiation with power structures to either maintain or challenge the status quo.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"mai.elshehaly@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Mai Elshehaly"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"mirela.reljan-delaney@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mirela Reljan-Delaney"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"j.dykes@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jason Dykes"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"j.d.wood@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jo Wood"},{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"sam.spiegel@ed.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sam Spiegel"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Mai Elshehaly"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The Master Narrative Framework for Visualization, which may be useful for exposing Master narratives, developing Alternative narratives and establishing Personal narratives in visualization design, critique and education.

We conducted a preliminary pilot study with ten individuals with varied expertise from rangingNLP, ML, and ethics, to specific domains. All individuals were actively using or working with AI/ML technology as part of their daily jobs. Through semi-structured interviews grounded in a set of concrete examples, we examined how CFEs influence participants' perceptions of the model's correctness, fairness, and trustworthiness, and how visualization of CFEs specifically influences those perceptions. We also surface how participants wrestle with their internal definitions of `explainability', relative to what CFEs present, their cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to the, much more widely studied phenomena, of comparing their baseline expectations of the model's performance. Compared to prior research, our findings highlight the sociotechnical frictions that CFEs surface but do not necessarily remedy.

This paper also collects the prior literature on boundary objects in visualization design studies, a methodology which maps closely to action research in organizations, and addresses the same problems of `knowing in common'. Process artifacts generated by visualization design studies function as boundary objects in their own right, facilitating knowledge transfer across disciplines within an organization. Currently, visualization faces the challenge of explaining how sense-making functions across domains, through visualization artifacts, and how these support decision-making. As a deeply interdisciplinary field, visualization should adopt the theory of boundary objects in order to embrace its plurality of domains and systems, whilst empowering its practitioners with a unified process-based theory.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["UC Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, United States"],"email":"jtotto@ucsc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jasmine Tan Otto"},{"affiliations":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"sd@scottdavidoff.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Scott Davidoff"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Jasmine Otto"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"A `transit network' map of knowledge transfer in complex organizations.

The success of these models stems from their ability to mimic human capabilities, namely visual perception in vision models, and analytical reasoning in large language models. As visual perception and analysis are fundamental to data visualization, in this position paper we ask: how can we harness foundation models to advance progress in visualization design? Specifically, how can multimodal foundation models (MFMs) guide visualization design through visual perception? We approach these questions by investigating the effectiveness of MFMs for perceiving visualization, and formalizing the overall visualization design and optimization space. Specifically, we think that MFMs can best be viewed as judges, equipped with the ability to criticize visualizations, and provide us with actions on how to improve a visualization. We provide a deeper characterization for text-to-image generative models, and multi-modal large language models, organized by what these models provide as output, and how to utilize the output for guiding design decisions.

It is important to equip university students with these essential data skills. To learn, design, and develop data visualization, students need knowledge of programming and data science topics. Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey's results, we identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets. We also distilled five opportunities for developing a successful data science and visualization course. These opportunities include clarifying the course structure, emphasizing visualization literacy early in the course, updating the course content according to student needs, using large real-world datasets, learning from industry professionals, and promoting collaboration among students.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"shrihariniramesh@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shri Harini Ramesh"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada","Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"fateme.rajabiyazdi@carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fateme Rajabiyazdi"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Shri Harini Ramesh"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05969","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop3a","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1008","time_end":"2024-10-13T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-13T12:30:00Z","title":"Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science","uid":"w-eduvis-1008","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"This report examines the implementation of the Solution Framework in a social impact project facilitated by VizForSocialGood.

While visualization has become integral to various areas, including education, our own ongoing collaboration has induced reflections and discussions we believe could benefit visualization research. In particular, we identify five key perspectives: surpassing traditional evaluation metrics by incorporating established educational measures; defining constructs based on existing learning and educational research frameworks; applying established cognitive theories to understand interpretation and interaction with visualizations; establishing uniform terminology across disciplines; and, fostering interdisciplinary convergence. We argue that by integrating educational research constructs, methodologies, and theories, visualization research can further pursue ecological validity and thereby improve the design and evaluation of visual tools. Our essay emphasizes the potential of intensified and systematic collaborations between educational scientists and visualization researchers to advance both fields, and in doing so craft visualization systems that support comprehension, retention, transfer, and critical thinking.

In cases where two or more power lines go offline, this contingency plan is no longer valid, and they must re-prepare and reason about the network in real time. A key network property that must be balanced is loadability--the range of permissible voltage levels for a specific bus (or node), understood as a function of power and its active (P) and reactive (Q) components. Loadability provides information of how much more demand a specific node can handle, before system became unstable. To increase loadability, the TSO can potentially make control actions that raise or lower P or Q, which results in change the voltage levels required to be within permissible limits. While many methods exist to calculate loadability and represent loadability to end users, there has been little focus on tailoring loadability visualizations to the unique needs of TSOs. In this paper we involve operations domain experts in a human centered design process to prototype two new loadability visualizations for TSOs.

A short power outage is merely a nuisance for most, and may not change people's locations. An outage that lasts for a few hours can result in spoiled food and medical supplies, and people will have to restock spoiled items. Long outages result in temperatures outside tolerable levels in homes, and may prompt people to acquire supplies, such as generators and gas, or change location. The long outages during Winter Storm Uri in Texas resulted in millions of dollars in property damage due to freezing pipes. This level of damage is expected to result in a sharp increase in supply runs and contractor activity.

Summarization for sensemaking involves information compression and insight extraction. Human guidance in sensemaking tasks can prioritize and cluster relevant information for LLMs. However, users must translate their cognitive thinking into natural language to communicate with LLMs. Can we use more readable and operable visual representations to guide the summarization process for sensemaking? Therefore, we propose introducing an intermediate step--a schematic visual workspace for human sensemaking--before the LLM generation to steer and refine the summarization process. We conduct a series of proof-of-concept experiments to investigate the potential for enhancing the summarization by GPT-4 through visual workspaces. Leveraging a textual sensemaking dataset with a ground truth summary, we evaluate the impact of a human-generated visual workspace on LLM-generated summarization of the dataset and assess the effectiveness of space-steered summarization. We categorize several types of extractable information from typical human workspaces that can be injected into engineered prompts to steer the LLM summarization. The results demonstrate how such workspaces can help align an LLM with the ground truth, leading to more accurate summarization results than without the workspaces.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Computer Science Department, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"tangxxwhu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xuxin Tang"},{"affiliations":["Dod, Laurel, United States"],"email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliations":["Department of Defense, College Park, United States"],"email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliations":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"canliu@cityu.edu.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Can Liu"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"naren@cs.vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Naren Ramakrishnan"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"north@vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chris North"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Xuxin Tang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"We created an intermediate workspace based on the ground truth of an intelligence analysis dataset to better understand the enhancements in LLM summarization achieved by integrating the worksapce.

We transformed poetry texts into syllables, identified their metrical structures, segmented verses into patterns, and then converted these patterns into visual representations. Following this, we computed and visualized the dissimilarities between these images, and overlaid their differences. Our findings suggest that the positional patterns across a poem play a pivotal role in effective poetry clustering, as demonstrated by our newly computed metrics. The results of our clustering experiments showed a marked improvement over previous attempts, thereby providing new insights into the composition and structure of Arabic poetry.

However, the process of creating interactive data visualization can be rather challenging due to the size and complexity of these datasets. Progressive data science offers a potential solution, enabling interaction with intermediate results during data exploration. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences with three health data visualization projects employing a progressive data science approach.

However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. We identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, we explore the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. We believe that leveraging constraints will balance the artistic and engineering aspects of data story generation.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"yu.zhe.s.shi@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yu-Zhe Shi"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"haotian.li@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Haotian Li"},{"affiliations":["Peking University, Beijing, China"],"email":"ruanlecheng@whai.pku.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lecheng Ruan"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Haotian Li"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"The architecture of data-driven storytelling with hierarchical constraints.

This is the first step toward enabling continuous implicit models such as MFA to support topological data analysis at scale.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"guanqunma94@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Guanqun Ma"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"dlenz@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Lenz"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tom Peterka"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bei Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-topoinvis/w-topoinvis-1027/w-topoinvis-1027_Preview.mp4?token=qfN8QlF5-hfBnFx-u_zUaqlRj9AvuCMVLamZhK9eq_0&expires=1730433600","bunny_ff_subtitles":"https://ieeevis-uploads.b-cdn.net/vis24/w-topoinvis/w-topoinvis-1027/w-topoinvis-1027_Preview.srt?token=lA4MEqtRmHXqAZxPCngtyJcdlU8tEXCX1OxWyYFcCHM&expires=1730433600","contributors":["Guanqun Ma"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Critical points identified by CPE-MFA and TTK-MFA.

The Jacobi set for two Morse functions is the set of all points where the functions' gradients are linearly dependent. Both the segmentation of the domain by Jacobi sets and the Jacobi sets themselves have proven to be useful tools in multi-field visualization, data analysis in various applications, and for accelerating extraction algorithms. On a triangulated grid, they can be calculated by a piecewise linear interpolation. In practice, Jacobi sets can become very complex and large due to noise and numerical errors. Some techniques for simplifying Jacobi sets exist, but these only reduce individual elements such as noise or are purely theoretical. These techniques often only change the visual representation of the Jacobi sets, but not the underlying data. In this paper, we present an algorithm that simplifies the Jacobi sets for 2D bivariate scalar fields and at the same time modifies the underlying bivariate scalar fields while preserving the essential structures of the fields. We use a neighborhood graph to select the areas to be reduced and collapse these cells individually. We investigate the influence of different neighborhood graphs and present an adaptation for the visualization of Jacobi sets that take the collapsed cells into account.

The classic definition is based on a continuous view of the gradient of a scalar function where its zeros are the critical points. These points are connected via gradient curves and surfaces emanating from saddle points, known as separatrices. In a discrete setting, the Morse-Smale complex is commonly extracted by constructing a combinatorial gradient assuming the steepest descent direction. Previous works have shown that this method results in a geometric embedding of the separatrices that can be fundamentally different from those in the continuous case. To achieve a similar embedding, different approaches for constructing a combinatorial gradient were proposed. In this paper, we show that these approaches generate a different topology, i.e., the connectivity between critical points changes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the steepest descent method can compute topologically and geometrically accurate Morse-Smale complexes when applied to certain types of grids.

Our experimental evaluation shows that Tetra-Spark achieves up to a 78x speedup and reduces memory usage by up to 80% when retrieving connectivity relations with the VT relation available. This optimized design further accelerates subsequent morphology computations, resulting in up to a 47.7x speedup.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, United States"],"email":"yhqian@umd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuehui Qian"},{"affiliations":["Clemson University, Clemson, United States"],"email":"guoxil@clemson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoxi Liu"},{"affiliations":["Clemson University, Clemson, United States"],"email":"fiurici@clemson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Federico Iuricich"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"deflo@umiacs.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Leila De Floriani"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yuehui Qian"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Figure: (a) The time cost (in minutes) for extracting connectivity relations and executing the algorithm in computing Forman gradient.

In this short paper, we study the prop- agation of multivariate data uncertainty in visualization. Although there have been a few advancements in probabilistic uncertainty vi- sualization of multivariate data, three critical challenges remain to be addressed. First, state-of-the-art probabilistic uncertainty visual- ization framework is limited to bivariate data (two variables). Sec- ond, the existing uncertainty visualization algorithms use compu- tationally intensive techniques and lack support for cross-platform portability. Third, as a consequence of the computational expense, integration into interactive production visualization tools is imprac- tical. In this work, we address all three issues and make a threefold contribution. First, we generalize the state-of-the-art probabilis- tic framework for bivariate data to multivariate data with a arbi- trary number of variables. Second, through utilization of VTK-m\u2019s shared-memory parallelism and cross-platform compatibility fea- tures, we demonstrate acceleration of multivariate uncertainty visu- alization on different many-core architectures, including OpenMP and AMD GPUs. Third, we demonstrate the integration of our al- gorithms with the ParaView software. We demonstrate utility of our algorithms through experiments on multivariate simulation data.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, United States"],"email":"gautamhari@outlook.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Gautam Hari"},{"affiliations":["Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, United States"],"email":"nrushad2001@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nrushad A Joshi"},{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"jay.wang@rutgers.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhe Wang"},{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"gongq@ornl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qian Gong"},{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"pugmire@ornl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Pugmire"},{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"kmorel@acm.org","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kenneth Moreland"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"crj@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chris R.

Linear interpolation can output vertices at the wrong location. Its inability to deal with sharp features and features smaller than grid cells can create holes and broken pieces in the extracted isosurface. Despite these limitations, isosurface visualizations typically do not include insight into the spatial location and the magnitude of these errors.

Our visualization tool helps identify the regions of high interpolation errors. It also allows users to query local areas for details and compare the differences between isosurfaces from different interpolation methods.

In this study, we showed participants forecasts of wind speed data and they made decisions based on their predictions about the future wind speed. We allowed participants to choose how many forecasts to view prior to making a decision, and we manipulated the ordering of the forecasts and the cost of each additional forecast. We found that participants viewed more forecasts when the outcome was more ambiguous. The order of the forecasts had little impact on their decisions when there was no cost for the additional information.

The data stories support stakeholder engagement through familiarity, interest, concern, participation, and ultimately actionable conclusions for citizens.","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"","paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","preprint_link":"","presentation_mode":"Virtual","session_id":"workshop9","slot_id":"w-vis4climate-1008","time_end":"2024-10-14T15:30:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-14T12:30:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-14T12:30:00Z","title":"Local Climate Data Stories: Data-driven Storytelling to Communicate Effects and Mitigation of Climate Change in a Local Context","uid":"w-vis4climate-1008","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":""},{"abstract":"Climate change\u2019s global impact calls for coordinated visualization efforts to enhance collaboration and communication among key partners such as domain experts, community members, and policy makers. We present a collaborative initiative, EcoViz, where visualization practitioners and key partners co-designed environmental data visualizations to illustrate impacts on ecosystems and the benefit of informed management and nature-based solutions. Our three use cases rely on unique processing pipelines to represent time-dependent natural phenomena by combining cinematic, scientific, and information visualization methods. Scientific outputs are displayed through narrative data-driven animations, interactive geospatial web applications, and immersive Unreal Engine applications. Each field\u2019s decision-making process is specific, driving design decisions about the best representation and medium for each use case. Data-driven cinematic videos with simple charts and minimal annotations proved most effective for engaging large, diverse audiences. This flexible medium facilitates reuse, maintains critical details, and integrates well into broader narrative videos. The need for interdisciplinary visualizations highlights the importance of funding to integrate visualization practitioners throughout the scientific process to better translate data and knowledge into informed policy and practice.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of California, San Diego, San Diego, United States"],"email":"jkb@ucsc.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jessica Marielle Kendall-Bar"},{"affiliations":["University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, United States"],"email":"inealey@ucsd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Isaac Nealey"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, United States"],"email":"icostell@ucsc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ian Costello"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, United States"],"email":"chlowrie@ucsc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christopher Lowrie"},{"affiliations":["University of California, San Diego, San Diego, United States"],"email":"khn009@ucsd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kevin Huynh Nguyen"},{"affiliations":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, United States"],"email":"pponganis@ucsd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Paul J.

However, while environmental awareness is common among consumers, it is not always clear what the current impact of one's own food choices are, and consequently it is not always clear how or why their own behavior must change, or how important the change is. Immersive technologies have been shown to aid in these aspects. In this paper, we bring food production into the home by means of handheld augmented reality. Using the current prototype, users can input which ingredients are in their meal on their smartphone, and after making a 3D scan of their kitchen, plants, livestock, feed, and water required for all are visualized in front of them. In this paper, we describe the design of the current prototype and, by analyzing the current state of research on virtual and augmented reality for sustainability research, we describe in which ways the application could be extended in terms of data, models, and interaction, to investigate the most prominent issues within environmental sustainability communications research.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Netherlands"],"email":"nina.rosa-dejong@wur.nl","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Nina Rosa"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","contributors":["Nina Rosa"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"image_caption":"Screenshots of the handheld augmented reality AwARe prototype, showing an ingredients list for a simple meat-centered meal, and crops, water and livestock required for the meat-centered meal, visualized in a kitchen and dining room.
