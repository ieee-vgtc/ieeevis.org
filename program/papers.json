[{"UID":"w-topoinvis-1027","abstract":"Advances in high-performance computing require new ways to represent large-scale scientific data to support data storage, data transfers, and data analysis within scientific workflows. Multivariate functional approximation (MFA) has recently emerged as a new continuous meshless representation that approximates raw discrete data with a set of piecewise smooth functions. An MFA model of data thus offers a compact representation and supports high-order evaluation of values and derivatives anywhere in the domain. In this paper, we present CPE-MFA, the first critical point extraction framework designed for MFA models of large-scale, high-dimensional data. CPE-MFA extracts critical points directly from an MFA model without the need for discretization or resampling. This is the first step toward enabling continuous implicit models such as MFA to support topological data analysis at scale.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"guanqunma94@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Guanqun Ma"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"dlenz@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Lenz"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tom Peterka"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bei Wang"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-topoinvis","event_title":"TopoInVis: Workshop on Topological Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-topoinvis-1027","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-topoinvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"TopoInVis","session_uid":"w-topoinvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["TopoInVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Critical Point Extraction from Multivariate Functional Approximation","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-topoinvis-1031","abstract":"3D symmetric tensor fields have a wide range of applications in science and engineering.

The Jacobi set for two Morse functions is the set of all points where the functions' gradients are linearly dependent. Both the segmentation of the domain by Jacobi sets and the Jacobi sets themselves have proven to be useful tools in multi-field visualization, data analysis in various applications, and for accelerating extraction algorithms. On a triangulated grid, they can be calculated by a piecewise linear interpolation. In practice, Jacobi sets can become very complex and large due to noise and numerical errors. Some techniques for simplifying Jacobi sets exist, but these only reduce individual elements such as noise or are purely theoretical. These techniques often only change the visual representation of the Jacobi sets, but not the underlying data. In this paper, we present an algorithm that simplifies the Jacobi sets for 2D bivariate scalar fields and at the same time modifies the underlying bivariate scalar fields while preserving the essential structures of the fields. We use a neighborhood graph to select the areas to be reduced and collapse these cells individually. We investigate the influence of different neighborhood graphs and present an adaptation for the visualization of Jacobi sets that take the collapsed cells into account. We apply our algorithm to a range of analytical and real-world data sets and compare it with established methods that also simplify the underlying bivariate scalar fields.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"],"email":"raith@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Felix Raith"},{"affiliations":["Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"],"email":"scheuermann@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gerik Scheuermann"},{"affiliations":["Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"],"email":"heine@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christian Heine"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-topoinvis","event_title":"TopoInVis: Workshop on Topological Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-topoinvis-1033","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-topoinvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"TopoInVis","session_uid":"w-topoinvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["TopoInVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Topological Simplifcation of Jacobi Sets for Piecewise-Linear Bivariate 2D Scalar Fields","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-topoinvis-1034","abstract":"The Morse-Smale complex is a standard tool in visual data analysis. The classic definition is based on a continuous view of the gradient of a scalar function where its zeros are the critical points. These points are connected via gradient curves and surfaces emanating from saddle points, known as separatrices. In a discrete setting, the Morse-Smale complex is commonly extracted by constructing a combinatorial gradient assuming the steepest descent direction. Previous works have shown that this method results in a geometric embedding of the separatrices that can be fundamentally different from those in the continuous case. To achieve a similar embedding, different approaches for constructing a combinatorial gradient were proposed. In this paper, we show that these approaches generate a different topology, i.e., the connectivity between critical points changes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the steepest descent method can compute topologically and geometrically accurate Morse-Smale complexes when applied to certain types of grids. Based on these observations, we suggest a method to attain both geometric and topological accuracy for the Morse-Smale complex of data sampled on a uniform grid.","authors":[{"affiliations":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"email":"sonlt@kth.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Son Le Thanh"},{"affiliations":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"email":"ankele@iai.uni-bonn.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Ankele"},{"affiliations":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"email":"weinkauf@kth.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tino Weinkauf"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-topoinvis","event_title":"TopoInVis: Workshop on Topological Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-topoinvis-1034","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-topoinvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"TopoInVis","session_uid":"w-topoinvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["TopoInVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Revisiting Accurate Geometry for the Morse-Smale Complexes","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-topoinvis-1038","abstract":"This paper presents a nested tracking framework for analyzing cycles in 2D force networks within granular materials.

However, most existing data structures struggle to efficiently encode the irregular connectivity of tetrahedral meshes with billions of vertices.  We address this problem by proposing a novel framework for efficient and scalable analysis of large tetrahedral meshes using Apache Spark. The proposed framework, called Tetra-Spark, features optimized approaches to locally compute many connectivity relations by first retrieving the Vertex-Tetrahedron (VT) relation. This strategy significantly improves Tetra-Spark's efficiency in performing morphology computations on large tetrahedral meshes.  To prove the effectiveness and scalability of such a framework, we conduct a comprehensive comparison against a vanilla Spark implementation for the analysis of tetrahedral meshes. Our experimental evaluation shows that Tetra-Spark achieves up to a 78x speedup and reduces memory usage by up to 80% when retrieving connectivity relations with the VT relation available. This optimized design further accelerates subsequent morphology computations, resulting in up to a 47.7x speedup.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, United States"],"email":"yhqian@umd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuehui Qian"},{"affiliations":["Clemson University, Clemson, United States"],"email":"guoxil@clemson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoxi Liu"},{"affiliations":["Clemson University, Clemson, United States"],"email":"fiurici@clemson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Federico Iuricich"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"deflo@umiacs.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Leila De Floriani"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-topoinvis","event_title":"TopoInVis: Workshop on Topological Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-topoinvis-1041","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-topoinvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"TopoInVis","session_uid":"w-topoinvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["TopoInVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Efficient representation and analysis for a large tetrahedral mesh using Apache Spark","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"a-ldav-1002","abstract":"Cuneiform is the earliest known system of writing, first developed for the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia in the second half of the 4th millennium BC. Cuneiform signs are obtained by impressing a stylus on fresh clay tablets. For certain purposes, e.g. authentication by seal imprint, some cuneiform tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes, which cannot be opened without destroying them. The aim of our interdisciplinary project is the non-invasive study of clay tablets. A portable X-ray micro-CT scanner is developed to acquire density data of such artifacts on a high-resolution, regular 3D grid at collection sites. The resulting volume data is processed through feature-preserving denoising, extraction of high-accuracy surfaces using a manifold dual marching cubes algorithm and extraction of local features by enhanced curvature rendering and ambient occlusion. For the non-invasive study of cuneiform inscriptions, the tablet is virtually separated from its envelope by curvature-based segmentation. The computational- and data-intensive algorithms are optimized for near-real-time offline usage with limited resources at collection sites. To visualize the complexity-reduced and octree-based compressed representation of surfaces, we develop and implement an interactive application. To facilitate the analysis of such clay tablets, we implement shape-based feature extraction algorithms to enhance cuneiform recognition. Our workflow supports innovative 3D display and interaction techniques such as autostereoscopic displays and gesture control.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"stephan.olbrich@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Stephan Olbrich"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Nanterre, France"],"email":"cecile.michel@cnrs.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"C\u00e9cile Michel"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christian.schroer@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christian Schroer"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"samaneh.ehteram@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Samaneh Ehteram"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.schropp@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Schropp"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"philipp.paetzold@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Philipp Paetzold"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"a-ldav","event_title":"LDAV: 13th IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"a-ldav-1002","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"associated","paper_type_color":"#2672B9","paper_type_name":"Associated Event","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","session_room":"None","session_title":"LDAV","session_uid":"a-ldav","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["LDAV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Efficient Analysis and Visualization of High-Resolution Computed Tomography Data for the Exploration of Enclosed Cuneiform Tablets","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"a-ldav-1003","abstract":"Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a well-established approach for the visualization of high-dimensional data sets. While DR methods are often applied to typical DR benchmark data sets in the literature, they might suffer from high runtime complexity and memory requirements, making them unsuitable for large data visualization especially in environments outside of high-performance computing. To perform DR on large data sets, we propose the use of out-of-sample extensions.  Such extensions allow inserting new data into existing projections, which we leverage to iteratively project data into a reference projection that consists only of a small manageable subset. This process makes it possible to perform DR out-of-core on large data, which would otherwise not be possible due to memory and runtime limitations. For metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), we contribute an implementation with out-of-sample projection capability since typical software libraries do not support it. We provide an evaluation of the projection quality of five common DR algorithms (MDS, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and autoencoders) using quality metrics from the literature and analyze the trade-off between the size of the reference set and projection quality. The runtime behavior of the algorithms is also quantified with respect to reference set size, out-of-sample batch size, and dimensionality of the data sets. Furthermore, we compare the out-of-sample approach to other recently introduced DR methods, such as PaCMAP and TriMAP, which claim to handle larger data sets than traditional approaches. To showcase the usefulness of DR on this large scale, we contribute a use case where we analyze ensembles of streamlines amounting to one billion projected instances.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"lucareichmann01@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luca Marcel Reichmann"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"david.haegele@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"David H\u00e4gele"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Weiskopf"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"a-ldav","event_title":"LDAV: 13th IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"a-ldav-1003","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"associated","paper_type_color":"#2672B9","paper_type_name":"Associated Event","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","session_room":"None","session_title":"LDAV","session_uid":"a-ldav","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["LDAV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Out-of-Core Dimensionality Reduction for Large Data via Out-of-Sample Extensions","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"a-ldav-1006","abstract":"Scientists generate petabytes of data daily to help uncover environmental trends or behaviors that are hard to predict. For example, understanding climate simulations based on the long-term average of temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables is essential to predicting and establishing root causes of future undesirable scenarios and assessing possible mitigation strategies. Unfortunately, bottlenecks in petascale workflows restrict scientists' ability to analyze and visualize the necessary information due to requirements for extensive computational resources, obstacles in data accessibility, and inefficient analysis algorithms. This paper presents an approach to managing, visualizing, and analyzing petabytes of data within a browser on equipment ranging from the top NASA supercomputer to commodity hardware like a laptop. Our approach is based on a novel data fabric abstraction layer that allows querying scientific information in a form that is user-friendly while hiding the complexities of dealing with file systems or cloud services. We also optimize network utilization while streaming from petascale repositories through state-of-the-art progressive compression algorithms. Based on this abstraction, we provide customizable dashboards that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, offering straightforward access to vast amounts of data typically not available to those without access to uniquely expensive hardware resources. Our dashboards provide and improve the ability to access and, more importantly, use massive data for a wide range of users, from top scientists with access to leadership-class computing environments to undergraduate students of disadvantaged backgrounds from minority-serving institutions. We focus on NASA's use of petascale climate datasets as an example of particular societal impact and, therefore, a case where achieving equity in science participation is critical. In particular, we validate our approach by improving the ability of climate scientist to explore their data even on the top NASA supercomputer, introducing the ability to study their data in a fully interactive environment instead of being limited to using pre-choreographed videos that can take days to generate each. We also successfully introduced the same dashboards and simplified training material in an undergraduate class on Geospatial Analysis in a minority-serving campus (Utah State Banding) with 69% of the Native American students and 86% being low-income. The same dashboards are also released in simplified form to the general public, providing an unparalleled democratization for the access and use of climate data that can be extended to most scientific domains.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"aashishpanta0@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Aashish Panta"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"xuanhuang@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuan Huang"},{"affiliations":["NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, United States"],"email":"nina.mccurdy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nina McCurdy"},{"affiliations":["NASA, mountain View, United States"],"email":"david.ellsworth@nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Ellsworth"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"amy.a.gooch@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Amy Gooch"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"scrgiorgio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Giorgio Scorzelli"},{"affiliations":["NASA, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"hector.torres.gutierrez@jpl.nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hector Torres"},{"affiliations":["caltech, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"pklein@caltech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Patrice Klein"},{"affiliations":["Utah State University Blanding, Blanding, United States"],"email":"gustavo.ovando@usu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gustavo Ovando-Montejo"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"pascucci.valerio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Valerio Pascucci"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"a-ldav","event_title":"LDAV: 13th IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"a-ldav-1006","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"associated","paper_type_color":"#2672B9","paper_type_name":"Associated Event","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","session_room":"None","session_title":"LDAV","session_uid":"a-ldav","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["LDAV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Web-based Visualization and Analytics of Petascale data: Equity as a Tide that Lifts All Boats","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"a-ldav-1011","abstract":"This paper describes the adaptation of a well-scaling parallel algorithm for computing Morse-Smale segmentations based on path compression to a distributed computational setting.

Volume visualization directly rendered from functional approximation generates high-quality rendering results without high-order artifacts caused by trilinear interpolations. However, querying an encoded functional approximation is computationally expensive, especially when the input dataset is large, making functional approximation impractical for interactive visualization. In this paper, we proposed a novel functional approximation multi-resolution representation, Adaptive-FAM, which is lightweight and fast to query. We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multi-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the Adaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive responsiveness. Our method can not only dramatically decrease the caching time, one of the main contributors to input latency, but also effectively improve the cache hit rate through prefetching. Our approach significantly outperforms the traditional function approximation method in terms of input latency while maintaining comparable rendering quality.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, United States"],"email":"jianxin.sun@huskers.unl.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jianxin Sun"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"dlenz@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Lenz"},{"affiliations":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, United States"],"email":"yu@cse.unl.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hongfeng Yu"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tom Peterka"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"a-ldav","event_title":"LDAV: 13th IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"a-ldav-1018","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"associated","paper_type_color":"#2672B9","paper_type_name":"Associated Event","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","session_room":"None","session_title":"LDAV","session_uid":"a-ldav","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["LDAV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Adaptive Multi-Resolution Encoding for Interactive Large-Scale Volume Visualization through Functional Approximation","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"s-vds-1000","abstract":"Efficient public transport systems are crucial for sustainable urban development as cities face increasing mobility demands. Yet, many public transport networks struggle to meet diverse user needs due to historical development, urban constraints, and financial limitations. Traditionally, planning of transport network structure is often based on limited surveys, expert opinions, or partial usage statistics. This provides an incomplete basis for decision-making. We introduce an data-driven approach to public transport planning and optimization, calculating detailed accessibility measures at the individual housing level. Our visual analytics workflow combines population-group-based simulations with dynamic infrastructure analysis, utilizing a scenario-based model to simulate daily travel patterns of varied demographic groups, including schoolchildren, students, workers, and pensioners. These population groups, each with unique mobility requirements and routines, interact with the transport system under different scenarios traveling to and from Points of Interest (POI), assessed through travel time calculations. Results are visualized through heatmaps, density maps, and network overlays, as well as detailed statistics. Our system allows us to analyze both the underlying data and simulation results on multiple levels of granularity, delivering both broad insights and granular details. Case studies with the city of Konstanz, Germany reveal key areas where public transport does not meet specific needs, confirmed through a formative user study. Due to the high cost of changing legacy networks, our analysis facilitates the identification of strategic enhancements, such as optimized schedules or rerouting, and few targeted stop relocations, highlighting consequential variations in accessibility to pinpointing critical service gaps. Our research advances urban transport analytics by providing policymakers and citizens with a system that delivers both broad insights with granular detail into public transport services for a data-driven quality assessment at housing-level detail.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"yannick.metz@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yannick Metz"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"dennis-fabian.ackermann@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dennis Ackermann"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"keim@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Keim"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"max.fischer@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Maximilian T.

We present a novel dimensionality reduction-based visualization for categorical data, which is based on defining the distance of two data items as the number of varying attributes. Our technique enables users to pre-attentively detect groups of similar data items and observe the properties of the projection, such as attributes strongly influencing the embedding. Our prototype visually encodes data properties in an enhanced scatterplot-like visualization, visualizing attributes in the background to show the distribution of categories. In addition, we propose two graph-based measures to quantify the plot's visual quality, which rank attributes according to their contribution to cluster cohesion. To demonstrate the capabilities of our similarity-based projection method, we compare it to Euler diagrams and Parallel Sets regarding visual scalability and evaluate it quantitatively on seven real-world datasets using a range of common quality measures. Further, we validate the benefits of our approach through an expert study with five data scientists analyzing the Titanic and Mushroom dataset with up to 23 attributes and 8124 category combinations.

While existing models like the Information Visualization Reference Model describe the data-to-visual mapping process, they often overlook a crucial intermediary step: design-specific transformations. This process, occurring after data transformation but before visual-data mapping, further derives data, such as groupings, layout, and statistics, that are essential to properly render the visualization. In this paper, we advocate for a deeper exploration of design-specific transformations, highlighting their importance in understanding visualization properties, particularly in relation to user tasks. We incorporate design-specific transformations into the Information Visualization Reference Model and propose a new formalism that encompasses the user task as a function over data. The resulting formalism offers three key benefits over existing visualization models: (1) describing tasks as compositions of functions, (2) enabling analysis of data transformations for visual-data mapping, and (3) empowering reasoning about visualization correctness and effectiveness. We further discuss the potential implications of this model on visualization theory and visualization experiment design.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Columbia University, New York City, United States"],"email":"ewu@cs.columbia.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"eugene Wu"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"remco@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-beliv","event_title":"BELIV: evaluation and BEyond - methodoLogIcal approaches for Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-beliv-1007","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","session_room":"None","session_title":"BELIV","session_uid":"w-beliv","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["BELIV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Design-Specific Transforms In Visualization","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-beliv-1008","abstract":"Stress is among the most commonly employed quality metrics and optimization criteria for dimension reduction projections of high-dimensional data. Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure the projection\u2019s accuracy or faithfulness to the full data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and other distance-based quality metrics analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make normalized stress scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a small benchmark.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"ksmelser@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kiran Smelser"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"jacobmiller1@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jacob Miller"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"stephen.kobourov@tum.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stephen Kobourov"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-beliv","event_title":"BELIV: evaluation and BEyond - methodoLogIcal approaches for Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-beliv-1008","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","session_room":"None","session_title":"BELIV","session_uid":"w-beliv","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["BELIV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Normalized Stress is Not Normalized: How to Interpret Stress Correctly","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-beliv-1009","abstract":"The cognitive processes involved in understanding and misunderstanding visualizations have not yet been fully clarified, even for well-studied designs, such as bar charts.

In policymaking, personal narratives are regarded as an important source of intelligence to shape public discourse and  policy. Therefore, policymakers are interested in the interplay between individual-level experiences and macro-political processes that play into shaping these experiences. In this context, visualisation is regarded as a medium for advocacy, creating a power balance between individuals and the power structures that influence their health and well-being. In this paper, we offer a politically-framed reflection on how visualisation creators define lived experience data, and what design choices they make for visualising them. We identify data characteristics and design choices that enable visualisation authors and consumers to engage in a process of narrative co-construction, while navigating structural forms of inequality. Our political framing is driven by ideas of master and alternative narratives from Diversity Science, in which authors and narrators engage in a process of negotiation with power structures to either maintain or challenge the status quo.","authors":[{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"mai.elshehaly@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Mai Elshehaly"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"mirela.reljan-delaney@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mirela Reljan-Delaney"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"j.dykes@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jason Dykes"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"j.d.wood@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jo Wood"},{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"sam.spiegel@ed.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sam Spiegel"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-beliv","event_title":"BELIV: evaluation and BEyond - methodoLogIcal approaches for Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-beliv-1018","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","session_room":"None","session_title":"BELIV","session_uid":"w-beliv","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["BELIV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Visualising Lived Experience: Learning from a Master and  Alternative Narrative Framing","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-beliv-1020","abstract":"The generation and presentation of counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are a commonly used, model-agnostic approach to helping end-users reason about the validity of AI/ML model outputs. By demonstrating how sensitive the model's outputs are to minor variations, CFEs are thought to improve understanding of the model's behavior, identify potential biases, and increase the transparency of 'black box models'.  Here, we examine how CFEs support a diverse audience, both with and without technical expertise, to understand the results of an LLM-informed sentiment analysis. We conducted a preliminary pilot study with ten individuals with varied expertise from ranging  NLP, ML, and ethics, to specific domains. All individuals were actively using or working with AI/ML technology as part of their daily jobs. Through semi-structured interviews grounded in a set of concrete examples, we examined how CFEs influence participants' perceptions of the model's correctness, fairness, and trustworthiness, and how visualization of CFEs specifically influences those perceptions. We also surface how participants wrestle with their internal definitions of `explainability', relative to what CFEs present, their cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to the, much more widely studied phenomena, of comparing their baseline expectations of the model's performance. Compared to prior research, our findings highlight the sociotechnical frictions that CFEs surface but do not necessarily remedy. We conclude with the design implications of developing transparent AI/ML visualization systems for more general tasks.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Tableau Research, Seattle, United States"],"email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anamaria Crisan"},{"affiliations":["Tableau Software, Seattle, United States"],"email":"nbutters@salesforce.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nathan Butters"},{"affiliations":["Tableau Software, Seattle, United States"],"email":"zoezoezoe.cc@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zoe Zoe"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-beliv","event_title":"BELIV: evaluation and BEyond - methodoLogIcal approaches for Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-beliv-1020","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","session_room":"None","session_title":"BELIV","session_uid":"w-beliv","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["BELIV"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Exploring Subjective Notions of Explainability through Counterfactual Visualization of Sentiment Analysis","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-beliv-1021","abstract":"The replication crisis has spawned a revolution in scientific methods, aimed at increasing the transparency, robustness, and reliability of scientific outcomes.

We approach these questions by investigating the effectiveness of MFMs for perceiving visualization, and formalizing the overall visualization design and optimization space. Specifically, we think that MFMs can best be viewed as judges, equipped with the ability to criticize visualizations, and provide us with actions on how to improve a visualization. We provide a deeper characterization for text-to-image generative models, and multi-modal large language models, organized by what these models provide as output, and how to utilize the output for guiding design decisions.

For each of these stages, we present examples of ways that these various forms of complexity can be used (or abused) in visualization design.

Human guidance in sensemaking tasks can prioritize and cluster relevant information for LLMs. However, users must translate their cognitive thinking into natural language to communicate with LLMs. Can we use more readable and operable visual representations to guide the summarization process for sensemaking? Therefore, we propose introducing an intermediate step--a schematic visual workspace for human sensemaking--before the LLM generation to steer and refine the summarization process. We conduct a series of proof-of-concept experiments to investigate the potential for enhancing the summarization by GPT-4 through visual workspaces. Leveraging a textual sensemaking dataset with a ground truth summary, we evaluate the impact of a human-generated visual workspace on LLM-generated summarization of the dataset and assess the effectiveness of space-steered summarization. We categorize several types of extractable information from typical human workspaces that can be injected into engineered prompts to steer the LLM summarization. The results demonstrate how such workspaces can help align an LLM with the ground truth, leading to more accurate summarization results than without the workspaces.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Computer Science Department, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"tangxxwhu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xuxin Tang"},{"affiliations":["Dod, Laurel, United States"],"email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliations":["Department of Defense, College Park, United States"],"email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliations":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"canliu@cityu.edu.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Can Liu"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"naren@cs.vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Naren Ramakrishnan"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"north@vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chris North"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-nlviz","event_title":"NLVIZ Workshop: Exploring Research Opportunities for Natural Language, Text, and Data Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-nlviz-1004","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-nlviz0","session_room":"None","session_title":"MLVIZ","session_uid":"w-nlviz","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["MLVIZ"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Steering LLM Summarization with Visual Workspaces for Sensemaking","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-nlviz-1007","abstract":"We explore the use of segmentation and summarization methods for the generation of real-time conversation topic timelines, in the context of glanceable Augmented Reality (AR) visualization.

Our objective is to make Arabic poetic works more accessible to readers of both Arabic and non-Arabic linguistic backgrounds by employing visualization, exploration, and analytical techniques.   We transformed poetry texts into syllables, identified their metrical structures, segmented verses into patterns, and then converted these patterns into visual representations. Following this, we computed and visualized the dissimilarities between these images, and overlaid their differences.   Our findings suggest that the positional patterns across a poem play a pivotal role in effective poetry clustering, as demonstrated by our newly computed metrics. The results of our clustering experiments showed a marked improvement over previous attempts, thereby providing new insights into the composition and structure of Arabic poetry.

Traditionally, the identification of such features has been limited to single tensor fields. However, it has become common to create ensembles to account for uncertainties and variability in simulations and measurements. In this work, we explore novel methods for describing and visualizing degenerate tensor locations in 3D symmetric second-order tensor field ensembles. We base our considerations on the tensor mode and analyze its practicality in characterizing the uncertainty of degenerate tensor locations before proposing a variety of visualization strategies to effectively communicate degenerate tensor information. We demonstrate our techniques for synthetic and simulation data sets.The results indicate that the interplay of different descriptions for uncertainty can effectively convey information on degenerate tensor locations.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"tadea.schmitz@uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tadea Schmitz"},{"affiliations":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-uncertainty","event_title":"Uncertainty Visualization: Applications, Techniques, Software, and Decision Frameworks","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-uncertainty-1007","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-uncertainty0","session_room":"None","session_title":"Uncertainty Visualization","session_uid":"w-uncertainty","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Uncertainty Visualization"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Exploring Uncertainty Visualization for Degenerate Tensors in 3D Symmetric Second-Order Tensor Field Ensembles","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-uncertainty-1009","abstract":"Understanding and communicating data uncertainty is crucial for informed decision-making across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and public policy.

Speech-forward representations led to an increase in risky decisions, and text-forward representations led to lower confidence. Contrary to prior work, speech-forward forecasts did not receive higher ratings of trust. Higher normalized pitch led to a slight increase in decision confidence, but other voice characteristics had minimal impact on decisions and trust.

While advanced DNNs offer impressive generalization capabilities, understanding factors such as model prediction quality, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights can enable domain scientists to make informed decisions about their data. However, DNNs inherently lack ability to estimate prediction uncertainty, necessitating new research to construct robust uncertainty-aware visualization techniques tailored for various visualization tasks. In this work, we propose uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model scalar field data sets effectively and comprehensively study the efficacy and benefits of estimated uncertainty information for volume visualization tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout). These techniques enable uncertainty-informed volume visualization in scalar field data sets. Our extensive exploration across multiple data sets demonstrates that uncertainty-aware models produce informative volume visualization results. Moreover, integrating prediction uncertainty enhances the trustworthiness of our DNN model, making it suitable for robustly analyzing and visualizing real-world scientific volumetric data sets.","authors":[{"affiliations":["IIT kanpur , Kanpur , India"],"email":"saklanishanu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shanu Saklani"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"email":"chitwangoel1010@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chitwan Goel"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"email":"shrey.bansal75@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shrey Bansal"},{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"jay.wang@rutgers.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhe Wang"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur), Kanpur, India"],"email":"soumya.cvpr@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Soumya Dutta"},{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"tushar.athawale@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tushar M.

First, state-of-the-art probabilistic uncertainty visual- ization framework is limited to bivariate data (two variables). Sec- ond, the existing uncertainty visualization algorithms use compu- tationally intensive techniques and lack support for cross-platform portability. Third, as a consequence of the computational expense, integration into interactive production visualization tools is imprac- tical. In this work, we address all three issues and make a threefold contribution. First, we generalize the state-of-the-art probabilis- tic framework for bivariate data to multivariate data with a arbi- trary number of variables.

Marching cubes (MC) algorithms with linear interpolation are commonly used for isosurface extraction and visualization.  Although linear interpolation is easy to implement, it has limitations when the underlying data is complex and high-order, which is the case for most real-world data. Linear interpolation can output vertices at the wrong location. Its inability to deal with sharp features and features smaller than grid cells can create holes and broken pieces in the extracted isosurface. Despite these limitations, isosurface visualizations typically do not include insight into the spatial location and the magnitude of these errors. We utilize high-order interpolation methods with MC algorithms and interactive visualization to highlight these uncertainties. Our visualization tool helps identify the regions of high interpolation errors. It also allows users to query local areas for details and compare the differences between isosurfaces from different interpolation methods. In addition, we employ high-order methods to identify and reconstruct possible features that linear methods cannot detect.  We showcase how our visualization tool helps explore and understand the extracted isosurface errors through synthetic and real-world data.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salk Lake City, United States"],"email":"touermi@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Timbwaoga A.

Our approach achieves at least a 99\\% level of rank preservation, with order flipping occurring only at pairs with extremely similar depth values that pose no statistical differences.

To bring some uncertainty visualization techniques, we build an interactive visualization system that utilizes a band-depth-based method that provides a statistical summary and visualization for fire front contours from the ensemble. We augment the visualiza- tion system with capabilities to study wildfires as a dynamic system.

In this work, we examine these issues as they relate to high-dimensional data visualization, the integration of discrete datasets and the continuous representations of those datasets, and the unique difficulties associated with systems that allow users to iterate between input and output spaces.

One common approach is to use multiple forecast visualizations, in which multiple forecasts are plotted on the same graph. This provides an implicit representation of the uncertainty in the data, but it is not clear how many forecasts to show, or how viewers might be influenced by seeing the more extreme forecasts rather than those closer to the mean. In this study, we showed participants forecasts of wind speed data and they made decisions based on their predictions about the future wind speed. We allowed participants to choose how many forecasts to view prior to making a decision, and we manipulated the ordering of the forecasts and the cost of each additional forecast. We found that participants viewed more forecasts when the outcome was more ambiguous. The order of the forecasts had little impact on their decisions when there was no cost for the additional information. However, when there was a cost for each forecast, the participants were much more likely to make a guess based on only the first forecast shown. In this case, showing one of the extreme forecasts first led to less optimal decisions.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, United States"],"email":"lematze@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Laura Matzen"},{"affiliations":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, United States"],"email":"mcstite@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mallory C Stites"},{"affiliations":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, United States"],"email":"kmdivis@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kristin M Divis"},{"affiliations":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"email":"abendeck3@gatech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alexander Bendeck"},{"affiliations":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"email":"john.stasko@cc.gatech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"John Stasko"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lace M.

Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey's results, we identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets. We also distilled five opportunities for developing a successful data science and visualization course. These opportunities include clarifying the course structure, emphasizing visualization literacy early in the course, updating the course content according to student needs, using large real-world datasets, learning from industry professionals, and promoting collaboration among students.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"shrihariniramesh@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shri Harini Ramesh"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada","Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"fateme.rajabiyazdi@carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fateme Rajabiyazdi"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-eduvis","event_title":"EduVis: Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-eduvis-1008","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-eduvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"EduVis","session_uid":"w-eduvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["EduVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-eduvis-1010","abstract":"This report examines the implementation of the Solution Framework in a social impact project facilitated by VizForSocialGood.

While visualization has become integral to various areas, including education, our own ongoing collaboration has induced reflections and discussions we believe could benefit visualization research. In particular, we identify five key perspectives: surpassing traditional evaluation metrics by incorporating established educational measures; defining constructs based on existing learning and educational research frameworks; applying established cognitive theories to understand interpretation and interaction with visualizations; establishing uniform terminology across disciplines; and, fostering interdisciplinary convergence. We argue that by integrating educational research constructs, methodologies, and theories, visualization research can further pursue ecological validity and thereby improve the design and evaluation of visual tools. Our essay emphasizes the potential of intensified and systematic collaborations between educational scientists and visualization researchers to advance both fields, and in doing so craft visualization systems that support comprehension, retention, transfer, and critical thinking. We argue that this reflective essay serves as a first point of departure for initiating dialogue that, we hope, could help further connect educational science and visualization, by proposing future empirical studies that take advantage of interdisciplinary approaches of mutual gain to both communities.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"konrad.schonborn@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Konrad J Sch\u00f6nborn"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"lonni.besancon@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lonni Besan\u00e7on"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-eduvis","event_title":"EduVis: Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-eduvis-1031","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-eduvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"EduVis","session_uid":"w-eduvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["EduVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"What Can Educational Science Offer Visualization?

In cases where a single power line goes offline, due to a natural event or scheduled outage, there typically will be a contingency plan that the TSO may utilize to mitigate the situation. In cases where two or more power lines go offline, this contingency plan is no longer valid, and they must re-prepare and reason about the network in real time. A key network property that must be balanced is loadability--the range of permissible voltage levels for a specific bus (or node), understood as a function of power and its active (P) and reactive (Q) components. Loadability provides information of how much more demand a specific node can handle, before system became unstable. To increase loadability, the TSO can potentially make control actions that raise or lower P or Q, which results in change the voltage levels required to be within permissible limits. While many methods exist to calculate loadability and represent loadability to end users, there has been little focus on tailoring loadability visualizations to the unique needs of TSOs. In this paper we involve operations domain experts in a human centered design process to prototype two new loadability visualizations for TSOs. We contribute a design paper that yields: (1) a working model of the operator's decision making process, (2) example artifacts of the two data visualization techniques, and (3) a critical qualitative expert review of our designs.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Montreal, Canada"],"email":"dmarino@cim.mcgill.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"David Marino"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"maxwellkeleher@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Maxwell Keleher"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Krakow, Poland"],"email":"krzysztof.chmielowiec@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Krzysztof Chmielowiec"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Montreal, Canada"],"email":"antony.hilliard@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Antony Hilliard"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Krakow, Poland"],"email":"pawel.dawidowski@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pawel Dawidowski"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-energyvis","event_title":"EnergyVis 2024: 4th Workshop on Energy Data Visualization","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-energyvis-3496","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-energyvis0","session_room":"None","session_title":"EnergyVis","session_uid":"w-energyvis","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["EnergyVis"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Operator-Centered Design of a Nodal Loadability Network Visualization","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-energyvis-4135","abstract":"This paper presents a dashboard to find and compare days with similar weather patterns within an 80-year historical weather dataset.

An outage that lasts for a few hours can result in spoiled food and medical supplies, and people will have to restock spoiled items. Long outages result in temperatures outside tolerable levels in homes, and may prompt people to acquire supplies, such as generators and gas, or change location. The long outages during Winter Storm Uri in Texas resulted in millions of dollars in property damage due to freezing pipes. This level of damage is expected to result in a sharp increase in supply runs and contractor activity.

In this paper, I explore how reimagining overlooked aspects of data visualization\u2014such as engagement, emotional resonance, communication, and community empowerment\u2014can contribute to achieving sustainability objectives. I argue that by focusing on inclusive data visualization that promotes clarity, understandability, and public participation, we can make complex data more relatable and actionable, fostering broader connections and mobilizing collective action on critical issues like climate change. Moreover, I discuss the role of emotional receptivity in environmental data communication, stressing the need for visualizations that respect diverse cultural perspectives and emotional responses to achieve impactful outcomes. Drawing on insights from a decade of research in public participation and community engagement, I aim to highlight how data visualization can democratize data access and increase public involvement in order to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, United States"],"email":"nmahyar@cs.umass.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Narges Mahyar"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-future","event_title":"VISions of the Future: Workshop on Sustainable Practices within Visualization and Physicalisation","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-future-1012","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-future0","session_room":"None","session_title":"VISions of the Future","session_uid":"w-future","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["VISions of the Future"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Reimagining Data Visualization to Address Sustainability Goals","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-future-1013","abstract":"This position paper discusses the role of data visualizations in journalism based on new areas of study such as visual journalism and data journalism, using examples from the coverage of the catastrophe that occurred in 2024 in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, affecting over 2 million people.

The selected set of emoji encodings can be used to generate configurable unit charts that combine plain text and emojis as word-scale graphics. These charts can serve to contrast values across multiple quantitative fields for each row in the data or to communicate trends over time. Any resulting chart is simply a block of text characters, meaning that it can be directly copied into a text message or posted on a communication platform such as Slack or Teams. This work represents a step toward our larger goal of developing novel, fun, and succinct data storytelling experiences that engage those who do not identify as data analysts.

However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. We identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, we explore the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. We believe that leveraging constraints will balance the artistic and engineering aspects of data story generation.","authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"yu.zhe.s.shi@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yu-Zhe Shi"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"haotian.li@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haotian Li"},{"affiliations":["Peking University, Beijing, China"],"email":"ruanlecheng@whai.pku.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lecheng Ruan"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-storygenai","event_title":"Workshop on Data Storytelling in an Era of Generative AI","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-storygenai-6168","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-storygenai0","session_room":"None","session_title":"Data Story GenAI","session_uid":"w-storygenai","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Data Story GenAI"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Constraint representation towards precise data-driven storytelling","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"w-storygenai-7043","abstract":"Creating data stories from raw data is challenging due to humans\u2019 limited attention spans and the need for specialized skills.

Like creative writing, where one reads to write a story, data professionals must effectively ``read\" visualizations to create compelling data stories. In education, helping students develop these skills can be achieved through exercises that ask them to create narratives from data plots, demonstrating both ``show\" (describing the plot) and ``tell\" (interpreting the plot). Providing formative feedback on these exercises is crucial but challenging in large-scale educational settings with limited resources. This study explores using GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM, to generate and evaluate narratives from data plots. The LLM was tested in zero-shot, one-shot, and two-shot scenarios, generating narratives and self-evaluating their depth. Human experts also assessed the LLM's outputs. Additionally, the study developed machine learning and LLM-based models to assess student-generated narratives using LLM-generated data. Human experts validated a subset of these machine assessments. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable formative assessment in teaching data storytelling skills, which has important implications for AI-supported educational interventions.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States"],"email":"narens1@umbc.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Naren Sivakumar"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States"],"email":"lujiec@umbc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lujie Karen Chen"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland,Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States"],"email":"io11937@umbc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pravalika Papasani"},{"affiliations":["University of maryland baltimore county, Hanover, United States"],"email":"vignam1@umbc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vigna Majmundar"},{"affiliations":["Towson University, Towson, United States"],"email":"jfeng@towson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinjuan Heidi Feng"},{"affiliations":["SRI International, Menlo Park, United States"],"email":"louise.yarnall@sri.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Louise Yarnall"},{"affiliations":["University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, United States"],"email":"jgong@umbc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiaqi Gong"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"w-storygenai","event_title":"Workshop on Data Storytelling in an Era of Generative AI","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"w-storygenai-7072","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"workshop","paper_type_color":"#f4a261","paper_type_name":"Workshop","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"w-storygenai0","session_room":"None","session_title":"Data Story GenAI","session_uid":"w-storygenai","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Data Story GenAI"],"time_stamp":"","title":"Show and Tell: Exploring Large Language Model\u2019s Potential in  Formative Educational Assessment of Data Stories","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-cga-10091124","abstract":"The Internet of Food (IoF) is an emerging field in smart foodsheds, involving the creation of a knowledge graph (KG) about the environment, agriculture, food, diet, and health.

For example, train journeys (jobs) consist of moves and stops (operations) to be served by rail tracks and stations (machines). A schedule is an assignment of the job operations to machines and times where and when they will be executed. The developers of computational methods for job scheduling need tools enabling them to explore how their methods work. At a high level of generality, we define the system of pertinent exploration tasks and a combination of visualizations capable of supporting the tasks. We provide general descriptions of the purposes, contents, visual encoding, properties, and interactive facilities of the visualizations and illustrate them with images from an example implementation in air traffic management. We justify the design of the visualizations based on the tasks, principles of creating visualizations for pattern discovery, and scalability requirements.

This is especially true for uncertain information, which is difficult for people to understand. Prior work has found that different methods of visualizing uncertain information can produce different patterns of decision making from users. However, uncertainty can also be represented via text or numerical information, and few studies have systematically compared these types of representations to visualizations of uncertainty. We present two experiments that compared visual representations of risk (icon arrays) to numerical representations (natural frequencies) in a wildfire evacuation task. Like prior studies, we found that different types of visual cues led to different patterns of decision making. In addition, our comparison of visual and numerical representations of risk found that people were more likely to evacuate when they saw visualizations than when they saw numerical representations. These experiments reinforce the idea that design choices are not neutral: seemingly minor differences in how information is represented can have important impacts on human risk perception and decision making.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"lematze@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Laura E.

To scout suitable players, coaches and analysts need to consider whether the players will perform well in a new team, which is hard to learn directly from their historical performances. Match simulation methods have been introduced to scout players by estimating their expected contributions to a new team. However, they usually focus on the simulation of match results and hardly support interactive analysis to navigate potential target players and compare them in fine-grained simulated behaviors. In this work, we propose a visual analytics method to assist soccer player scouting based on match simulation. We construct a two-level match simulation framework for estimating both match results and player behaviors when a player comes to a new team. Based on the framework, we develop a visual analytics system, Team-Scouter, to facilitate the simulative-based soccer player scouting process through player navigation, comparison, and investigation. With our system, coaches and analysts can find potential players suitable for the team and compare them on historical and expected performances. For an in-depth investigation of the players' expected performances, the system provides a visual comparison between the simulated behaviors of the player and the actual ones. The usefulness and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world dataset and an expert interview.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"caoanqi28@163.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anqi Cao"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"xxie@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiao Xie"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"2366385033@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Runjin Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"1282533692@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuxin Tian"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"fanmu_032@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mu Fan"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"zhang_hui@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1031","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full1","session_room":"None","session_title":"Applications: Sports.

Both sports fans and experts have a demand for analyzing sports tactics. Existing approaches allow users to visually perceive the multivariate tactical effects. However, these approaches require users to experience a complex reasoning process to connect the multiple interactions within each tactic to the final tactical effect. In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs. Based on the framework, we design and develop Smartboard, an agent-based interactive visualization system for fine-grained tactical analysis, especially for play design. Smartboard provides users with a structured process of setup, simulation, and evolution, allowing for iterative exploration of tactics based on specific personalized scenarios.

Basketball tactics, involving a complex series of actions, require substantial knowledge to be fully understood. This complexity leads to a need for additional information and explanation, which can distract fans from the game. To tackle these challenges, we present Sportify, a Visual Question Answering system that integrates narratives and embedded visualization for demystifying basketball tactical questions, aiding fans in understanding various game aspects. We propose three novel action visualizations (i.e., Pass, Cut, and Screen) to demonstrate critical action sequences. To explain the reasoning and logic behind players\u2019 actions, we leverage a large-language model (LLM) to generate narratives. We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations. We evaluated Sportify with basketball fans to investigate its impact on understanding of tactics, and how different personal perspectives of narratives impact the understanding of complex tactic with action visualizations. Our evaluation with basketball fans demonstrates Sportify\u2019s capability to deepen tactical insights and amplify the viewing experience. Furthermore, third-person narration assists people in getting in-depth game explanations while first-person narration enhances fans\u2019 game engagement.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Harvard University, Allston, United States"],"email":"chungyi347@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Chunggi Lee"},{"affiliations":["Harvard University, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"mlin@g.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tica Lin"},{"affiliations":["Harvard University, Cambridge, United States"],"email":"pfister@seas.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanspeter Pfister"},{"affiliations":["University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Minneapolis, United States"],"email":"ztchen@umn.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chen Zhu-Tian"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1351","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full1","session_room":"None","session_title":"Applications: Sports.

With their investment knowledge and professional skills, fund managers gain a competitive advantage over the average investor in the market. Consequently, investors prefer entrusting their investments to fund managers rather than directly investing in funds. For these investors, the primary concern is selecting a suitable fund manager. While previous studies have employed quantitative or qualitative methods to analyze various aspects of fund managers, such as performance metrics, personal characteristics, and performance persistence, they often face challenges when dealing with a large candidate space. Moreover, distinguishing whether a fund manager's performance stems from skill or luck poses a challenge, making it difficult to align with investors' preferences in the selection process. To address these challenges, this study characterizes the requirements of investors in selecting suitable fund managers and proposes an interactive visual analytics system called FMLens. This system streamlines the fund manager selection process, allowing investors to efficiently assess and deconstruct fund managers' investment styles and abilities across multiple dimensions. Additionally, the system empowers investors to scrutinize and compare fund managers' performances. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through two case studies and a qualitative user study. Feedback from domain experts indicates that the system excels in analyzing fund managers from diverse perspectives, enhancing the efficiency of fund manager evaluation and selection.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Longfei Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chen Cheng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"He Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiyuan Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yun Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuanwu Yue"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wong Kam-Kwai"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haipeng Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Suting Hong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quan Li"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3394745","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243394745","image_caption":"","keywords":["Financial Data, Fund Manager Selection, Visual Analytics"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full1","session_room":"None","session_title":"Applications: Sports.

Machine learning methods for impact dynamics analysis are incomprehensible and rigid in terms of their interpretability and transparency, whilst stakeholders require interactive tools for informed decision-making. Nevertheless, developing such a tool is challenging due to the substantial, heterogeneous NFT transaction data and the requirements for flexible, customized interactions. To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects. We first conduct a formative study and summarize analysis criteria, including substitution mechanisms, impact attributes, and design requirements from stakeholders. Next, we propose the Minimal Substitution Model to simulate substitutive systems of NFT projects that can be feasibly represented as node-link graphs. Particularly, we utilize attribute-aware techniques to embed the project status and stakeholder behaviors in the layout design. Accordingly, we develop a multi-view visual analytics system, namely NFTracer, allowing interactive analysis of impact dynamics in NFT transactions. We demonstrate the informativeness, effectiveness, and usability of NFTracer by performing two case studies with domain experts and one user study with stakeholders. The studies suggest that NFT projects featuring a higher degree of similarity are more likely to substitute each other. The impact of NFT projects within substitutive systems is contingent upon the degree of stakeholders\u2019 influx and projects\u2019 freshness.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yifan Cao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qing Shi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lucas Shen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kani Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wei Zeng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3402834","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243402834","image_caption":"","keywords":["Stakeholders, Nonfungible Tokens, Social Networking Online, Visual Analytics, Network Analyzers, Measurement, Layout, Impact Dynamics Analysis, Non Fungible Tokens NF Ts, NFT Transaction Data, Substitutive Systems, Visual Analytics"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full1","session_room":"None","session_title":"Applications: Sports.

We contribute a GUI-based color palette linter as a design probe that covers perception, accessibility, context, and other design criteria, and use it to explore visual explanations, integrated fixes, and user defined linting rules. Through a formative interview study and theory-driven analysis, we find that linters can be meaningfully integrated into graphical contexts  thereby addressing many of their core issues.  We discuss implications for integrating linters into visualization tools, developing improved assertion languages, and supporting end-user tunable advice---all laying the groundwork for more effective visualization linters in any context.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States","University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"mcnutt.andrew@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Andrew M McNutt"},{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"maureen.stone@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Maureen Stone"},{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"jheer@uw.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1290","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full10","session_room":"None","session_title":"Designing Palettes and Encodings","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Designing Palettes and Encodings"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T19:27:00Z","title":"Mixing Linters with GUIs: A Color Palette Design Probe","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1595","abstract":"Assigning discriminable and harmonic colors to samples according to their class labels and spatial distribution can generate attractive visualizations and facilitate data exploration. However, as the number of classes increases, it is challenging to generate a high-quality color assignment result that accommodates all classes simultaneously. A practical solution is to organize classes into a hierarchy and then dynamically assign colors during exploration. However, existing color assignment methods fall short in generating high-quality color assignment results and dynamically aligning them with hierarchical structures. To address this issue, we develop a dynamic color assignment method for hierarchical data, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. This method simultaneously considers color discriminability, color harmony, and spatial distribution at each hierarchical level. By using the colors of parent classes to guide the color assignment of their child classes, our method further promotes both consistency and clarity across hierarchical levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating dynamic color assignment results with quantitative experiments and a user study.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"jiashu0717c@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jiashu Chen"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"vicayang496@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"jiazl22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zelin Jia"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"tarolancy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lanxi Xiao"},{"affiliations":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"email":"shixia@tsinghua.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1595","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full10","session_room":"None","session_title":"Designing Palettes and Encodings","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Designing Palettes and Encodings"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T19:39:00Z","title":"Dynamic Color Assignment for Hierarchical Data","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1836","abstract":"Shape is commonly used to distinguish between categories in multi-class scatterplots. However, existing guidelines for choosing effective shape palettes rely largely on intuition and do not consider how these needs may change as the number of categories increases. Unlike color, shapes can not be represented by a numerical space, making it difficult to propose general guidelines or design heuristics for using shape effectively. This paper presents a series of four experiments evaluating the efficiency of 39 shapes across three tasks: relative mean judgment tasks, expert preference, and correlation estimation. Our results show that conventional means for reasoning about shapes, such as filled versus unfilled, are insufficient to inform effective palette design. Further, even expert palettes vary significantly in their use of shape and corresponding effectiveness. To support effective shape palette design, we developed a model based on pairwise relations between shapes in our experiments and the number of shapes required for a given design. We embed this model in a palette design tool to give designers agency over shape selection while incorporating empirical elements of perceptual performance captured in our study. Our model advances understanding of shape perception in visualization contexts and provides practical design guidelines that can help improve categorical data encodings.

We conducted an experiment to determine the accuracy, speed, and confidence with which readers infer numerical data values for the mapped regions. We found that, when only informed about the total numerical value represented by the whole cartogram without any legend, the distribution of estimates for individual regions was centered near the true value with substantial spread. Legends with grid lines significantly reduced the spread but led to a tendency to underestimate the values. Comparing differences between regions or between cartograms revealed that legends and grid lines slowed the estimation without improving accuracy. However, participants were more likely to complete the tasks when legends and grid lines were present, particularly when the area units represented by these features could be interactively selected.

Each sentence is a comparison: the mean of these is higher than those; this difference is smaller than that. What determines which comparisons are made first? The viewer's goals and expertise matter, but the way that values are visually grouped together within the chart also impacts those comparisons. Research from psychology suggests that comparisons involve multiple steps. First, the viewer divides the visualization into a set of units. This might include a single bar or a grouped set of bars. Then the viewer selects and compares two of these units, perhaps noting that one pair of bars is longer than another. Viewers might take an additional third step and perform a second-order comparison, perhaps determining that the difference between one pair of bars is greater than the difference between another pair. We create a visual comparison taxonomy that allows us to develop and test a sequence of hypotheses about which comparisons people are more likely to make when reading a visualization. We find that people tend to compare two groups before comparing two individual bars and that second-order comparisons are rare. Visual cues like spatial proximity and color can influence which elements are grouped together and selected for comparison, with spatial proximity being a stronger grouping cue. Interestingly, once the viewer grouped together and compared a set of bars, regardless of whether the group is formed by spatial proximity or color similarity, they no longer consider other possible groupings in their comparisons.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andrew Lovett"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Steven Franconeri"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3289292","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233289292","image_caption":"","keywords":["comparison, perception, visual grouping, bar charts, verbal conclusions."],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full10","session_room":"None","session_title":"Designing Palettes and Encodings","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Designing Palettes and Encodings"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T20:15:00Z","title":"What Does the Chart Say?

However, this attention has predominantly been on the use of text in standalone visualizations (such as text annotation overlays) or augmenting text stories supported by a series of independent views. In this paper, we shift from the traditional focus on single-chart annotations to characterize the nuanced but crucial communication role of text in the complex environment of interactive dashboards. Through a survey and analysis of 190 dashboards in the wild, plus 13 expert interview sessions with experienced dashboard authors, we highlight the distinctive nature of text as an integral component of the dashboard experience, while delving into the categories, semantic levels, and functional roles of text, and exploring how these text elements are coalesced by dashboard authors to guide and inform dashboard users. Our contributions are threefold. First, we distill qualitative and quantitative findings from our studies to characterize current practices of text use in dashboards, including a categorization of text-based components and design patterns. Second, we leverage current practices and existing literature to propose, discuss, and validate recommended practices for text in dashboards, embodied as a set of 12 heuristics that underscore the semantic and functional role of text in offering navigational cues, contextualizing data insights, supporting reading order, among other concerns. Third, we reflect on our findings to identify gaps and propose opportunities for data visualization researchers to push the boundaries on text usage for dashboards, from authoring support and interactivity to text generation and content personalization. Our research underscores the significance of elevating text as a first-class citizen in data visualization, and the need to support the inclusion of textual components and their interactive affordances in dashboard design.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Tableau Research, Seattle, United States"],"email":"nicole.sultanum@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Nicole Sultanum"},{"affiliations":["Tableau Research, Palo Alto, United States"],"email":"vsetlur@tableau.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vidya Setlur"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1060","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full11","session_room":"None","session_title":"Text, Annotation, and Metaphor","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Text, Annotation, and Metaphor"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:06:00Z","title":"From Instruction to Insight: Exploring the Semantic and Functional Roles of Text in Interactive Dashboards","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1295","abstract":"Annotations play a vital role in highlighting critical aspects of visualizations, aiding in data externalization and exploration, collaborative sensemaking, and visual storytelling. However, despite their widespread use, we identified a lack of a design space for common practices for annotations. In this paper, we evaluated over 1,800 static annotated charts to understand how people annotate visualizations in practice. Through qualitative coding of these diverse real-world annotated charts, we explored three primary aspects of annotation usage patterns: analytic purposes for chart annotations (e.g., present, identify, summarize, or compare data features), mechanisms for chart annotations (e.g., types and combinations of annotations used, frequency of different annotation types across chart types, etc.), and the data source used to generate the annotations. We then synthesized our findings into a design space of annotations, highlighting key design choices for chart annotations. We presented three case studies illustrating our design space as a practical framework for chart annotations to enhance the communication of visualization insights.

Metaphors play an essential part in visual communication and are frequently employed to explain complex concepts. However, their use is often based on intuition, rather than following a formal process. At present, we lack tools and language for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g., infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains (biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science. This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex scientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory tool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on a spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual metaphors.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"email":"hana.pokojna@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hana Pokojn\u00e1"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Orsay, France","Inria, Saclay, France"],"email":"tobias.isenberg@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":["University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"email":"stefan.bruckner@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stefan Bruckner"},{"affiliations":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"email":"kozlikova@fi.muni.cz","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barbora Kozlikova"},{"affiliations":["University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"email":"laura.garrison@uib.no","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Laura Garrison"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1316","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full11","session_room":"None","session_title":"Text, Annotation, and Metaphor","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Text, Annotation, and Metaphor"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T12:54:00Z","title":"The Language of Infographics: Toward Understanding Conceptual Metaphor Use in Scientific Storytelling","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1594","abstract":"The visualization community has a rich history of reflecting upon visualization design flaws.

To address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws through the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and categorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur. Specifically, we analyzed 2227 flawed data visualizations collected from an online gallery and derived a design task-associated taxonomy containing 76 specific design flaws. These flaws were further classified into three high-level categories (i.e., misinformation, uninformativeness, unsociability) and ten subcategories (e.g., inaccuracy, unfairness, ambiguity). Next, we organized five focus groups to explore why these design flaws occur and identified seven causes of the flaws. Finally, we proposed a research agenda for combating visualization design flaws and summarize nine research opportunities.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China","Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"email":"xingyulan96@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xingyu Lan"},{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"coraline.liu.dataviz@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yu Liu"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1594","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full11","session_room":"None","session_title":"Text, Annotation, and Metaphor","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Text, Annotation, and Metaphor"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:18:00Z","title":"\"I Came Across a Junk\": Understanding Design Flaws of Data Visualization from the Public's Perspective","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1810","abstract":"Classical bibliography, by researching preserved catalogs from both official archives and personal collections of accumulated books, examines the books throughout history, thereby revealing cultural development across historical periods.

The recommendation method can learn the background knowledge and annotation patterns that experts subconsciously integrate into the data during prior annotation processes. CataAnno searches for the most relevant examples previously annotated and recommends to the user. Meanwhile, the cross-linked views assist users in comprehending the correlations between entries and offer explanations for these recommendations. Evaluation and expert feedback confirm that the CataAnno system, by offering high-quality recommendations and visualizing the relationships between entries, can mitigate the necessity for specialized knowledge during the annotation process.

However, a recent metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and thus broaden visualization research's scope and practical contribution to this evolving field. We first survey recent significant shifts, emerging challenges, and computational practices in journalism. We then summarize six roles of computing in journalism and their implications. Based on these implications, we provide propositions for visualization research concerning each role. Ultimately, by mapping the roles and propositions onto a proposed ecological model and contextualizing existing visualization research, we surface seven general topics and a series of research agendas that can guide future visualization research at this intersection.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yu Fu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"John Stasko"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3287585","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233287585","image_caption":"","keywords":["Computational journalism,  data visualization,  data-driven storytelling, journalism"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full12","session_room":"None","session_title":"Journalism and Public Policy","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Journalism and Public Policy"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T19:15:00Z","title":"More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243355884","abstract":"News articles containing data visualizations play an important role in informing the public on issues ranging from public health to politics. Recent research on the persuasive appeal of data visualizations suggests that prior attitudes can be notoriously difficult to change. Inspired by an NYT article, we designed two experiments to evaluate the impact of elicitation and contrasting narratives on attitude change, recall, and engagement. We hypothesized that eliciting prior beliefs leads to more elaborative thinking that ultimately results in higher attitude change, better recall, and engagement. Our findings revealed that visual elicitation leads to higher engagement in terms of feelings of surprise. While there is an overall attitude change across all experiment conditions, we did not observe a significant effect of belief elicitation on attitude change. With regard to recall error, while participants in the draw trend elicitation exhibited significantly lower recall error than participants in the categorize trend condition, we found no significant difference in recall error when comparing elicitation conditions to no elicitation. In a follow-up study, we added contrasting narratives with the purpose of making the main visualization (communicating data on the focal issue) appear strikingly different. Compared to the results of Study 1, we found that contrasting narratives improved engagement in terms of surprise and interest but interestingly resulted in higher recall error and no significant change in attitude. We discuss the effects of elicitation and contrasting narratives in the context of topic involvement and the strengths of temporal trends encoded in the data visualization.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Milad Rogha"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Subham Sah"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alireza Karduni"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Douglas Markant"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wenwen Dou"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3355884","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243355884","image_caption":"","keywords":["Data Visualization, Market Research, Visualization, Uncertainty, Data Models, Correlation, Attitude Control, Belief Elicitation, Visual Elicitation, Data Visualization, Contrasting Narratives"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full12","session_room":"None","session_title":"Journalism and Public Policy","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Journalism and Public Policy"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T19:27:00Z","title":"The Impact of Elicitation and Contrasting Narratives on Engagement, Recall and Attitude Change with News Articles Containing Data Visualization","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1121","abstract":"Acute stroke demands prompt diagnosis and treatment to achieve optimal patient outcomes. However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jykim@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jaeyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"sihyeon@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sihyeon Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliations":["Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"gooday19@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Keon-Joo Lee"},{"affiliations":["Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin-si, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"bkim@hufs.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bohyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"braindoc@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"HEE JOON"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1121","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full13","session_room":"None","session_title":"Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T17:42:00Z","title":"PhenoFlow: A Human-LLM Driven Visual Analytics System for Exploring Large and Complex Stroke Datasets","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1474","abstract":"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering have made chatbot customization more accessible, significantly reducing barriers to tasks that previously required programming skills. However, prompt evaluation, especially at the dataset scale, remains complex due to the need to assess prompts across thousands of test instances within a dataset. Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation. In the context of text summarization, our workflow advocates evaluation with summary characteristics (feature metrics) such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements for text summarization through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the xeffectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation of summarization prompts, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks. For future works, we advocate moving towards feature-oriented evaluation of LLM prompts and discuss unsolved challenges in terms of human-agent interaction.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of California Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"ytlee@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"abahukhandi@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aryaman Bahukhandi"},{"affiliations":["University of California at Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"dyuliu@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dongyu Liu"},{"affiliations":["University of California at Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1474","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full13","session_room":"None","session_title":"Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T18:18:00Z","title":"Towards Dataset-scale and Feature-oriented Evaluation of Text Summarization in Large Language Model Prompts","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1504","abstract":"A wide range of visualization authoring interfaces enable the creation of highly customized visualizations. However, prioritizing expressiveness often impedes the learnability of the authoring interface. The diversity of users, such as varying computational skills and prior experiences in user interfaces, makes it even more challenging for a single authoring interface to satisfy the needs of a broad audience. In this paper, we introduce a framework to balance learnability and expressivity in a visualization authoring system. Adopting insights from learnability studies, such as multimodal interaction and visualization literacy, we explore the design space of blending multiple visualization authoring interfaces for supporting authoring tasks in a complementary and flexible manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of blending interfaces, we implemented a proof-of-concept system, Blace, that combines four common visualization authoring interfaces\u2014template-based, shelf configuration, natural language, and code editor\u2014that are tightly linked to one another to help users easily relate unfamiliar interfaces to more familiar ones. Using the system, we conducted a user study with 12 domain experts who regularly visualize genomics data as part of their analysis workflow. Participants with varied visualization and programming backgrounds were able to successfully reproduce unfamiliar visualization examples without a guided tutorial in the study. Feedback from a post-study qualitative questionnaire further suggests that blending interfaces enabled participants to learn the system easily and assisted them in confidently editing unfamiliar visualization grammar in the code editor, enabling expressive customization. Reflecting on our study results and the design of our system, we discuss the different interaction patterns that we identified and design implications for blending visualization authoring interfaces.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"sehi_lyi@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sehi L'Yi"},{"affiliations":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"email":"a.v.d.brandt@tue.nl","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Astrid van den Brandt"},{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"etowah_adams@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Etowah Adams"},{"affiliations":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States"],"email":"huyen_nguyen@hms.harvard.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huyen N.

We propose LEVA, a framework that uses large language models to enhance users' VA workflows at multiple stages: onboarding, exploration, and summarization. To support onboarding, we use large language models to interpret visualization designs and view relationships based on system specifications. For exploration, we use large language models to recommend insights based on the analysis of system status and data to facilitate mixed-initiative exploration. For summarization, we present a selective reporting strategy to retrace analysis history through a stream visualization and generate insight reports with the help of large language models. We demonstrate how LEVA can be integrated into existing visual analytics systems. Two usage scenarios and a user study suggest that LEVA effectively aids users in conducting visual analytics.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yixing Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xinyi Zhao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Junjie Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zekai Shao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Cagatay Turkay"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3368060","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243368060","image_caption":"","keywords":["Insight recommendation, mixed-initiative, interface agent, large language models, visual analytics"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full13","session_room":"None","session_title":"Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T17:54:00Z","title":"LEVA: Using Large Language Models to Enhance Visual Analytics","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243368621","abstract":"The use of natural language interfaces (NLIs) to create charts is becoming increasingly popular due to the intuitiveness of natural language interactions. One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users' natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuan Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Weiwei Cui"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dazhen Deng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xinjing Yi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yurun Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haidong Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3368621","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243368621","image_caption":"","keywords":["Natural language interfaces, large language models, data visualization"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full13","session_room":"None","session_title":"Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T18:06:00Z","title":"ChartGPT: Leveraging LLMs to Generate Charts from Abstract Natural Language","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243408255","abstract":"Generative text-to-image models, which allow users to create appealing images through a text prompt, have seen a dramatic increase in popularity in recent years.

Based on the review and analysis of the prompting history, users can better understand the impact of prompt changes and have a more effective control of image generation. A quantitative user study and qualitative interviews demonstrate that PrompTHis can help users review the prompt history, make sense of the model, and plan their creative process.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuhan Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanning Shao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Can Liu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kai Xu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiaoru Yuan"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3408255","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243408255","image_caption":"","keywords":["Text visualization, image visualization, text-to-image generation, editing history, provenance, generative art"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full13","session_room":"None","session_title":"Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Natural Language and Multimodal Interaction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T18:30:00Z","title":"PrompTHis: Visualizing the Process and Influence of Prompt Editing during Text-to-Image Creation","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1067","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but also raise significant security concerns, particularly regarding the harm they can cause, such as generating fake news that manipulates public opinion on social media and providing responses to unethical activities.

Integrating LLMs into visualization systems presents challenges, and we categorize these challenges into three alignments: domain problems with LLMs, visualization with LLMs, and interaction with LLMs. To achieve these alignments, we propose a framework and outline a workflow to guide the application of fine-tuned LLMs to enhance visual interactions for domain-specific tasks. These alignment challenges are critical in education because of the need for an intelligent visualization system to support beginners' self-regulated learning. Therefore, we apply the framework to education and introduce Tailor-Mind, an interactive visualization system designed to facilitate self-regulated learning for artificial intelligence beginners. Drawing on insights from a preliminary study, we identify self-regulated learning tasks and fine-tuning objectives to guide visualization design and tuning data construction.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research.

Based on the neighborhood of the currently explored entities in KGs, KnowNet provides recommendations for further inquiry, aiming to guide a comprehensive understanding without overlooking critical aspects. A progressive graph visualization is proposed to show the alignment between LLMs and KGs, track previous inquiries, and connect this history with current queries and next-step recommendations.

Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as spatial layouts. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs exhibit such sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggled to generate semantically diverse and factually accurate takeaways. In Experiment 2, we used the optimal configurations to generate 30 chart takeaways each for eight visualizations across four layouts and two datasets in both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to human takeaways, we found that the takeaways LLMs generated often did not match the types of comparisons made by humans. In Experiment 3, we examined the effect of chart context and data on LLM takeaways. We found that LLMs, unlike humans, exhibited variation in takeaway comparison types for different bar charts using the same bar layout. Overall, our case study evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human chart takeaways.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Huichen Will Wang"},{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, Seattle, United States"],"email":"jhoffs@adobe.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jane Hoffswell"},{"affiliations":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, United States"],"email":"yukithane@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sao Myat Thazin Thane"},{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, San Jose, United States"],"email":"victorbursztyn2022@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor S.

In structural biology, this process is necessary to semi-automatically composite large mesoscale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. The current approaches require manual fitting in three dimensions to start, resulting in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. The DiffFit approach enables domain scientists to fit new structures automatically and visualize the results for inspection and interactive revision. The fitting begins with differentiable three-dimensional (3D) rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates followed by sampling the density values at the atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we proposed a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. This loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring the fitting accuracy and an improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found it to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases: automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes and facilitating the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in identifying unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFitViewer) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

Analyzing various characteristics of these regions helps the experts design the transfer of the desired function from one protein to another. This process is denoted as loop grafting. We designed a set of interactive visualizations that provide experts with visual support through all the loop grafting pipeline steps. The workflow is divided into several phases, reflecting the steps of the pipeline. Each phase is supported by a specific set of abstracted 2D visual representations of proteins and their loops that are interactively linked with the 3D View of proteins. By sequentially passing through the individual phases, the user shapes the list of loops that are potential candidates for loop grafting. Finally, the actual in-silico insertion of the loop candidates from one protein to the other is performed, and the results are visually presented to the user. In this way, the fully computational rational design of proteins and their loops results in newly designed protein structures that can be further assembled and tested through in-vitro experiments.

By analyzing cellular interactions, biomedical experts can gain a more accurate understanding of the intricate relationships between cancer and immune cells. Recent methods have focused on inferring interaction based on the proximity of cells in low-resolution 2D multi-channel imaging data. By contrast, we analyze cell interactions by quantifying the presence and levels of specific proteins within a tissue sample (protein expressions) extracted from high-resolution 3D multi-channel volume data. Such analyses have a strong exploratory nature and require a tight integration of domain experts in the analysis loop to leverage their deep knowledge. We propose two complementary semi-automated approaches to cope with the increasing size and complexity of the data interactively: On the one hand, we interpret cell-to-cell interactions as edges in a cell graph and analyze the image signal (protein expressions) along those edges, using spatial as well as abstract visualizations. Complementary, we propose a cell-centered approach, enabling scientists to visually analyze polarized distributions of proteins in three dimensions, which also captures neighboring cells with biochemical and cell biological consequences.

Such a development comes at the cost of increased demands on throughput in genomic data analysis. In this paper, we use the task of copy number variant (CNV) analysis as a context for exploring visualization concepts for clinical genomics. CNV calls are generated algorithmically, but time-consuming manual intervention is needed to separate relevant findings from irrelevant ones in the resulting large call candidate lists. We present a visualization environment, named Copycat, to support this review task in a clinical scenario.  Key components are a scatter-glyph plot replacing the traditional list visualization, and a glyph representation designed for at-a-glance relevance assessments. Moreover, we present results from a formative evaluation of the prototype by domain specialists, from which we elicit insights to guide both prototype improvements and visualization for clinical genomics in general.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Emilia St\u00e5hlbom"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jesper Molin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Claes Lundstr\u00f6m"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Anders Ynnerman"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3385118","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243385118","image_caption":"","keywords":["Visualization, genomics, copy number variants, clinical decision support, evaluation"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full15","session_room":"None","session_title":"Biological Data Visualization","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Biological Data Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:51:00Z","title":"Visualization for diagnostic review of copy number variants in complex DNA sequencing data","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243411786","abstract":"We present a novel method for the interactive construction and rendering of extremely large molecular scenes, capable of representing multiple biological cells in atomistic detail. Our method is tailored for scenes, which are procedurally constructed, based on a given set of building rules. Rendering of large scenes normally requires the entire scene available in-core, or alternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory hierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory management, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly. The key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction strategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is available in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is populated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire scene. Most of the grid cells are not filled with geometry, only those are populated that are potentially seen by the camera. The atomistic detail is populated in a compute shader and its representation is connected with acceleration data structures for hardware ray-tracing of modern GPUs. Objects which are far away, where atomistic detail is not perceivable from a given viewpoint, are represented by a triangle mesh mapped with a seamless texture, generated from the rendering of geometry from atomistic detail. The algorithm consists of two pipelines, the construction-compute pipeline, and the rendering pipeline, which work together to render molecular scenes at an atomistic resolution far beyond the limit of the GPU memory containing trillions of atoms. We demonstrate our technique on multiple models of SARS-CoV-2 and the red blood cell.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ruwayda Alharbi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ond\u02c7rej Strnad"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Klein"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ivan Viola"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3411786","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243411786","image_caption":"","keywords":["Interactive rendering, view-guided scene construction, biological data, hardware ray tracing"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full15","session_room":"None","session_title":"Biological Data Visualization","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Biological Data Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:27:00Z","title":"\u201cNanomatrix: Scalable Construction of Crowded Biological Environments\u201d","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1150","abstract":"Composite visualization represents a widely embraced design that combines multiple visual representations to create an integrated view.

In traditional screen-based visualisations, focus-and-context techniques allow visualisation users to keep a full dataset in view while making detailed selections. Such techniques have been studied extensively on desktop to allow precise selection within large data sets, but they have not been explored in immersive 3D modalities. In this paper we develop a novel immersive focus-and-context technique based on a ``magic portal'' metaphor adapted specifically for data visualisation scenarios. An extendable-hand interaction technique is used to place a portal close to the region of interest.The other end of the portal then opens comfortably within the user's physical reach such that they can reach through to precisely select individual data points.Through a controlled study with 12 participants, we find strong evidence that portals reduce overshoots in selection and overall hand trajectory length, reducing arm and shoulder fatigue compared to ranged interaction without the portal.  The portals also enable us to use a robot arm to provide haptic feedback for data within the limited volume of the portal region. In a second study with another 12 participants we found that haptics provided a positive experience (qualitative feedback) but did not significantly reduce fatigue. We demonstrate applications for portal-based selection through two use-case scenarios.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"dai.shaozhang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shaozhang Dai"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"yi.li5@monash.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yi Li"},{"affiliations":["The University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus), Kelowna, Canada"],"email":"barrett.ens@ubc.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Barrett Ens"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"lonni.besancon@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lonni Besan\u00e7on"},{"affiliations":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"email":"tgdwyer@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tim Dwyer"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1699","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full16","session_room":"None","session_title":"Immersive Visualization and Visual Analytics","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Immersive Visualization and Visual Analytics"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:06:00Z","title":"Precise Embodied Data Selection in Room-scale Visualisations While Retaining View Context","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20233299602","abstract":"Data transformation is an essential step in data science.

We conducted a preliminary user study to investigate whether and how data integration should be incorporated directly into the visual analytics process. We used two interface alternatives featuring contrasting approaches to the data preparation and analysis workflow: manual file-based ex-situ integration as a separate step from visual analytics operations; and automatic UI-based in-situ integration merged with visual analytics operations. Participants were asked to complete specific and free-form tasks with each interface, browsing for patterns, generating insights, and summarizing relationships between attributes distributed across multiple files. Analyzing participants' interactions and feedback, we found both task completion time and total interactions to be similar across interfaces and tasks, as well as unique integration strategies between interfaces and emergent behaviors related to satisficing and cognitive bias. Participants' time spent and interactions revealed that in-situ integration enabled users to spend more time on analysis tasks compared with ex-situ integration. Participants' integration strategies and analytical behaviors revealed differences in interface usage for generating and tracking hypotheses and insights. With these results, we synthesized preliminary guidelines for designing future visual analytics interfaces that can support integrating attributes throughout an active analysis process.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adam Coscia"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ashley Suh"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alex Endert"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3334513","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233334513","image_caption":"","keywords":["Visual analytics, Data integration, User interface design, Integration strategies, Analytical behaviors."],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full16","session_room":"None","session_title":"Immersive Visualization and Visual Analytics","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Immersive Visualization and Visual Analytics"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:18:00Z","title":"Preliminary Guidelines For Combining Data Integration and Visual Data Analysis","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20233340770","abstract":"We present VoxAR, a method to facilitate an effective visualization of volume-rendered objects in optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs).

We address this challenge in a two-step approach. First, VoxAR determines an appropriate placement of the volume-rendered object in the real-world scene by evaluating a set of spatial and environmental objectives, managed as user-selected preferences and pre-defined constraints. We achieve a real-time solution by implementing the objectives using a GPU shader language.  Next, VoxAR adjusts the colors of the input transfer function (TF) based on the real-world placement region. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization method that adjusts the TF colors such that the resulting volume-rendered pixels are discernible against the background and the TF maintains the perceptual mapping between the colors and data intensity values.

However, existing solutions based on generative adversarial networks often require many training images and take significant training time. Still, issues such as low quality, consistency, and flexibility persist. This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"ktang2@nd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1391","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full17","session_room":"None","session_title":"Machine Learning for Visualization","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Machine Learning for Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T12:54:00Z","title":"StyleRF-VolVis: Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields for Expressive Volume Visualization","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1427","abstract":"Numerical simulation serves as a cornerstone in scientific modeling, yet the process of fine-tuning simulation parameters poses significant challenges.

Second, by directly dragging structure-related features in the visualizations, users can intuitively understand the controlling effect of different parameters. Third, with the understanding from the earlier step, users can steer ParamsDrag to produce dynamic visual outcomes.

Additionally, it enables efficient simulation parameter recommendation and exploration. We integrate SurroFlow and a genetic algorithm as the backend of a visual interface to support effective user-guided ensemble simulation exploration and visualization. Our framework significantly reduces the computational costs while enhancing the reliability and exploration capabilities of scientific surrogate models.","authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States","The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"shen.1250@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"JINGYI SHEN"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States","The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"duan.418@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuhan Duan"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States","The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States"],"email":"hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1599","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full17","session_room":"None","session_title":"Machine Learning for Visualization","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Machine Learning for Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:18:00Z","title":"SurroFlow: A Flow-Based Surrogate Model for Parameter Space Exploration and Uncertainty Quantification","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1866","abstract":"Feature grid Scene Representation Networks (SRNs) have been applied to scientific data as compact functional surrogates for analysis and visualization. As SRNs are black-box lossy data representations, assessing the prediction quality is critical for scientific visualization applications to ensure that scientists can trust the information being visualized. Currently, existing architectures do not support inference time reconstruction quality assessment, as coordinate-level errors cannot be evaluated in the absence of ground truth data. By employing the uncertain neural network architecture in feature grid SRNs, we obtain prediction variances during inference time to facilitate confidence-aware data reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-decoder SRN (MDSRN) architecture consisting of a shared feature grid with multiple lightweight multi-layer perceptron decoders. MDSRN can generate a set of plausible predictions for a given input coordinate to compute the mean as the prediction of the multi-decoder ensemble and the variance as a confidence score. The coordinate-level variance can be rendered along with the data to inform the reconstruction quality, or be integrated into uncertainty-aware volume visualization algorithms. To prevent the misalignment between the quantified variance and the prediction quality, we propose a novel variance regularization loss for ensemble learning that promotes the Regularized multi-decoder SRN (RMDSRN) to obtain a more reliable variance that correlates closely to the true model error. We comprehensively evaluate the quality of variance quantification and data reconstruction of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Mean Field Variational Inference (MFVI), Deep Ensemble (DE), and Predicting Variance (PV) in comparison with our proposed MDSRN and RMDSRN applied to state-of-the-art feature grid SRNs across diverse scalar field datasets. We demonstrate that RMDSRN attains the most accurate data reconstruction and competitive variance-error correlation among uncertain SRNs under the same neural network parameter budgets. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of uncertainty-aware volume rendering and shed light on the potential of incorporating uncertain predictions in improving the quality of volume rendering for uncertain SRNs. Through ablation studies on the regularization strength and decoder count, we show that MDSRN and RMDSRN are expected to perform sufficiently well with a default configuration without requiring customized hyperparameter settings for different datasets.","authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"xiong.336@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tianyu Xiong"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"wurster.18@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Skylar Wolfgang Wurster"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States","Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tom Peterka"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States"],"email":"hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1866","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full17","session_room":"None","session_title":"Machine Learning for Visualization","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Machine Learning for Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:30:00Z","title":"Regularized Multi-Decoder Ensemble for an Error-Aware Scene Representation Network","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20233345373","abstract":"Traditional deep learning algorithms assume that all data is available during training, which presents challenges when handling large-scale time-varying data.

In the second stage, we utilize an offline knowledge distillation algorithm to extract knowledge from the trained models and aggregate it into a single model.

Without any prior knowledge about the spatial distribution of values, we are forced to sample densely from INRs to perform visualization tasks like iso-surface extraction which can be very computationally expensive. Recently, range analysis has shown promising results in improving the efficiency of geometric queries, such as ray casting and hierarchical mesh extraction, on INRs for 3D geometries by using arithmetic rules to bound the output range of the network within a spatial region. However, the analysis bounds are often too conservative for complex scientific data. In this paper, we present an improved technique for range analysis by revisiting the arithmetic rules and analyzing the probability distribution of the network output within a spatial region. We model this distribution efficiently as a Gaussian distribution by applying the central limit theorem. Excluding low probability values, we are able to tighten the output bounds, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the value range, and hence more accurate identification of iso-surface cells and more efficient iso-surface extraction on INRs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of the iso-surface extraction time on four datasets compared to the original range analysis method and can also be generalized to other geometric query tasks.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Haoyu Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3365089","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243365089","image_caption":"","keywords":["Iso-surface extraction, implicit neural representation, uncertainty propagation, affine arithmetic."],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full17","session_room":"None","session_title":"Machine Learning for Visualization","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Machine Learning for Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T12:42:00Z","title":"Improving Efficiency of Iso-Surface Extraction on Implicit Neural Representations Using Uncertainty Propagation","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1185","abstract":"This paper presents an interactive technique to explain visual patterns in network visualizations to analysts who do not understand these visualizations and who are learning to read them.

However, none of these existing methods can be directly applied to optimizing non-differentiable criteria without special accommodation. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning framework for graph drawing, called SmartGD, which can optimize any quantitative aesthetic goals even though they are non-differentiable. In the cases where the aesthetic goal is too abstract to be described mathematically, SmartGD can draw graphs in a similar style as a collection of good layout examples, which might be selected by humans based on the abstract aesthetic goal.

We have implemented the concept in a tool called D-TOUR PROTOTYPE, which allows authors to craft custom interactive dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically generated tours can still be customized to use different media (e.g., video, audio, and highlighting) or new narratives to produce an onboarding experience tailored to an individual user.

A few scene abstractions have been proposed, but they are restricted to specific applications for a limited set of visualization types. A unified and expressive model of data visualization scenes for different applications has been missing. To fill this gap, we present Manipulable Semantic Components (MSC), a computational representation of data visualization scenes, to support applications in scene understanding and augmentation. MSC consists of two parts: a unified object model describing the structure of a visualization scene in terms of semantic components, and a set of operations to generate and modify the scene components. We demonstrate the benefits of MSC in three applications: visualization authoring, visualization deconstruction and reuse, and animation specification.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"leozcliu@umd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Zhicheng Liu"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"cchen24@umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chen Chen"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"hookerj100@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"John Hooker"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1416","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full19","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visualization Recommendation","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visualization Recommendation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T13:30:00Z","title":"Manipulable Semantic Components: a Computational Representation of Data Visualization Scenes","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1472","abstract":"Trained on vast corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to encode visualization design knowledge and best practices.

We contribute DracoGPT, a method for extracting, modeling, and assessing visualization design preferences from LLMs. To assess varied tasks, we develop two pipelines--DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend--to model LLMs prompted to either rank or recommend visual encoding specifications. We use Draco as a shared knowledge base in which to represent LLM design preferences and compare them to best practices from empirical research. We demonstrate that DracoGPT can accurately model the preferences expressed by LLMs, enabling analysis in terms of Draco design constraints. Across a suite of backing LLMs, we find that DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend moderately agree with each other, but both substantially diverge from guidelines drawn from human subjects experiments. Future work can build on our approach to expand Draco's knowledge base to model a richer set of preferences and to provide a robust and cost-effective stand-in for LLMs.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Huichen Will Wang"},{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"mgord@cs.stanford.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mitchell L.

There is an increasing trend in leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve an end-to-end visualization recommendation. However, existing ML-based approaches implicitly assume that there is only one appropriate visualization for a specific dataset, which is often not true for real applications. Also, they often work like a black box, and are difficult for users to understand the reasons for recommending specific visualizations. To fill the research gap, we propose AdaVis, an adaptive and explainable approach to recommend one or multiple appropriate visualizations for a tabular dataset. It leverages a box embedding-based knowledge graph to well model the possible one-to-many mapping relations among different entities (i.e., data features, dataset columns, datasets, and visualization choices). The embeddings of the entities and relations can be learned from dataset-visualization pairs. Also, AdaVis incorporates the attention mechanism into the inference framework. Attention can indicate the relative importance of data features for a dataset and provide fine-grained explainability. Our extensive evaluations through quantitative metric evaluations, case studies, and user interviews demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaVis.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Songheng Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yong Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haotian Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3316469","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233316469","image_caption":"","keywords":["Visualization Recommendation, Logical Reasoning, Data Visualization, Knowledge Graph"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full19","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visualization Recommendation","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visualization Recommendation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T12:30:00Z","title":"AdaVis: Adaptive and Explainable Visualization Recommendation for Tabular Data'","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243374571","abstract":"Visualization Recommendation Systems (VRSs) are a novel and challenging field of study aiming to help generate insightful visualizations from data and support non-expert users in information discovery.

We denote these systems as \"agnostic\" VRSs since they do not rely on human-provided constraints and rules but try to learn the task autonomously. Despite the high application potential of agnostic VRSs, their progress is hindered by several obstacles, including the absence of standardized datasets to train recommendation algorithms, the difficulty of learning design rules, and defining quantitative criteria for evaluating the perceptual effectiveness of generated plots.

To address this issue, we propose a new representation model, Chart2Vec, to learn a universal embedding of visualizations with context-aware information. Chart2Vec aims to support a wide range of downstream visualization tasks such as recommendation and storytelling. Our model considers both structural and semantic information of visualizations in declarative specifications. To enhance the context-aware capability, Chart2Vec employs multi-task learning on both supervised and unsupervised tasks concerning the cooccurrence of visualizations. We evaluate our method through an ablation study, a user study, and a quantitative comparison. The results verified the consistency of our embedding method with human cognition and showed its advantages over existing methods.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Qing Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ying Chen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ruishi Zou"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wei Shuai"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yi Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiazhe Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nan Cao"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3383089","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243383089","image_caption":"","keywords":["Representation Learning, Multi-view Visualization, Visual Storytelling, Visualization Embedding"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full19","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visualization Recommendation","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visualization Recommendation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T12:54:00Z","title":"Chart2Vec: A Universal Embedding of Context-Aware Visualizations","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1059","abstract":"Digital twin models are of high interest to Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) oncologists, who have to navigate a series of complex treatment decisions that weigh the efficacy of tumor control against toxicity and mortality risks.

To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning digital twin (DT) to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system.

Such an optimization is governed by multiple, conflicting objectives and it is performed across a multi-dimensional parameter space.  The extent of the parameter space, the complexity of the non-linear model of the system,  as well as the time needed per simulation run and factors that are not modeled in the simulation necessitate an iterative, semi-automatic approach.   We present an interactive visual optimization approach, where the user works with a p-h diagram to steer an iterative, guided optimization process. A deep learning (DL) model provides estimates for parameters, given a target characterization of the system, while numerical simulation is used to compute system characteristics for an ensemble of parameter sets.   Since the DL model only serves as an approximation of the inverse of the cooling system and since target characteristics can be chosen according to different, competing objectives, an iterative optimization process is realized, developing multiple sets of intermediate solutions, which are visually related to each other.    The standard p-h diagram, integrated interactively in this approach, is complemented by a dual, also interactive visual representation of additional expressive measures representing the system characteristics.   We show how the known four-points semantic of the p-h diagram meaningfully transfers to the dual data representation.  When evaluating this approach in the automotive domain, we found that our solution helped with the overall comprehension of the cooling system and that it lead to a faster convergence during optimization.

For the global-level analysis, we present three coupled visualizations to delineate the changes of quantum states and the underlying reasons: a Probability Summary View to overview the probability evolution of quantum states; a State Evolution View to enable an in-depth analysis of the influence of quantum gates on the quantum states; a Gate Explanation View to show the individual qubit states and facilitate a better understanding of the effect of quantum gates. For the local-level analysis, we design a novel geometrical visualization dandelion chart to explicitly reveal how the quantum amplitudes affect the probability of the quantum state. We thoroughly evaluated QuantumEyes as well as the novel dandelion chart integrated into it through two case studies on different types of quantum algorithms and in-depth expert interviews with 12 domain experts.

Together with experts in nondestructive evaluation, we designed a novel interactive multimodal visualization approach to create a combined view of the co-registered X-ray and neutron acquisitions of industrial objects. Using an automatic topological segmentation of the bivariate histogram of X-ray and neutron values as a starting point, the system provides a simple yet effective interface to easily create, explore, and adjust a multimodal isualization. We propose a widget with simple brushing interactions that enables the user to quickly correct the segmented histogram results. Our semiautomated system enables domain experts to intuitively explore large multimodal datasets without the need for either advanced segmentation algorithms or knowledge of visualization echniques. We demonstrate our approach using synthetic examples, industrial phantom objects created to stress multimodal scanning techniques, and real-world objects, and we discuss expert feedback.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huang, Xuan"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Miao, Haichao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kim, Hyojin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Townsend, Andrew"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Champley, Kyle"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tringe, Joseph"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pascucci, Valerio"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bremer, Peer-Timo"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3382607","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243382607","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full2","session_room":"None","session_title":"Applications: Industry, Computing, and Medicine","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Applications: Industry, Computing, and Medicine"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T19:39:00Z","title":"Bimodal Visualization of Industrial X-ray and Neutron Computed Tomography Data","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1100","abstract":"``Correlation does not imply causation'' is a famous mantra in statistical and visual analysis. However, consumers of visualizations often draw causal conclusions when only correlations between variables are shown. In this paper, we investigate factors that contribute to causal relationships users perceive in visualizations. We collected a corpus of concept pairs from variables in widely used datasets and created visualizations that depict varying correlative associations using three typical statistical chart types. We conducted two MTurk studies on (1) preconceived notions on causal relations without charts, and (2) perceived causal relations with charts, for each concept pair. Our results indicate that people make assumptions about causal relationships between pairs of concepts even without seeing any visualized data. Moreover, our results suggest that these assumptions constitute causal priors that, in combination with visualized association, impact how data visualizations are interpreted. The results also suggest that causal priors may lead to over- or under-estimation in perceived causal relations in different circumstances, and that those priors can also impact users' confidence in their causal assessments. In addition, our results align with prior work, indicating that chart type may also affect causal inference. Using data from the studies, we develop a model to capture the interaction between causal priors and visualized associations as they combine to impact a user's perceived causal relations. In addition to reporting the study results and analyses, we provide an open dataset of causal priors for 56 specific concept pairs that can serve as a potential benchmark for future studies. We also suggest remaining challenges and heuristic-based guidelines to help designers improve visualization design choices to better support visual causal inference.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliations":["UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"borland@renci.org","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Borland"},{"affiliations":["Davidson College, Davidson, United States"],"email":"tapeck@davidson.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tabitha C.

Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic. However, human reliance on non-normative heuristics may prove advantageous in certain circumstances. We investigate scenarios where human intuition might surpass idealized statistical rationality. In two experiments, we examine individuals\u2019 accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.

Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms \u201c judgment \u201d and \u201c decision making \u201d are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence people's judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.

However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools.

Within a single interface, Compress and Compare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced behavior changes by comparing models\u2019 predictions, weights, and activations. We demonstrate how Compress and Compare supports common compression analysis tasks through two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language models and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models.

Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex algorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying evolutionary operators and population dynamics within MOEAs aligns well with a visual analytics paradigm. This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs. Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations. In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"zhangzr32021@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zherui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"yangf2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fan Yang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"ranchengcn@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ran Cheng"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"mayx@sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuxin Ma"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1179","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full21","session_room":"None","session_title":"Model-checking and Validation","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Model-checking and Validation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T13:30:00Z","title":"ParetoTracker: Understanding Population Dynamics in Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms through Visual Analytics","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1258","abstract":"Providing effective guidance for users has long been an important and challenging task for efficient exploratory visual analytics, especially when selecting variables for visualization in high-dimensional datasets.

We conducted two empirical experiments to investigate individuals\u2019 ability to visually validate linear regression models (linear trends) and to examine the impact of common visualization designs on validation quality. The first experiment showed that the level of accuracy for visual estimation of slope (i.e., fitting a line to data) is higher than for visual validation of slope (i.e., accepting a shown line). Notably, we found bias toward slopes that are \u201ctoo steep\u201d in both cases. This lead to novel insights that participants naturally assessed regression with orthogonal distances between the points and the line (i.e., ODR regression) rather than the common vertical distances (OLS regression). In the second experiment, we investigated whether incorporating common designs for regression visualization (error lines, bounding boxes, and confidence intervals) would improve visual validation. Even though error lines reduced validation bias, results failed to show the desired improvements in accuracy for any design. Overall, our findings suggest caution in using visual model validation for linear trends in scatterplots.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"braun@cs.uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Daniel Braun"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"remco@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"affiliations":["University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, United States"],"email":"gleicher@cs.wisc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Gleicher"},{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"landesberger@cs.uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tatiana von Landesberger"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1547","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full21","session_room":"None","session_title":"Model-checking and Validation","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Model-checking and Validation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T12:42:00Z","title":"Beware of Validation by Eye: Visual Validation of Linear Trends in Scatterplots","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20233302308","abstract":"We visualize the predictions of multiple machine learning models to help biologists as they interactively make decisions about cell lineage---the development of a (plant) embryo from a single ovum cell. Based on a confocal microscopy dataset, traditionally biologists manually constructed the cell lineage, starting from this observation and reasoning backward in time to establish their inheritance. To speed up this tedious process, we make use of machine learning (ML) models trained on a database of manually established cell lineages to assist the biologist in cell assignment. Most biologists, however, are not familiar with ML, nor is it clear to them which model best predicts the embryo's development. We thus have developed a visualization system that is designed to support biologists in exploring and comparing ML models, checking the model predictions, detecting possible ML model mistakes, and deciding on the most likely embryo development. To evaluate our proposed system, we deployed our interface with six biologists in an observational study. Our results show that the visual representations of machine learning are easily understandable, and our tool, LineageD+, could potentially increase biologists' working efficiency and enhance the understanding of embryos.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jiayi Hong"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ross Maciejewski"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alain Trubuil"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3302308","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233302308","image_caption":"","keywords":["Visualization, visual analytics, machine learning, comparing ML predictions, human-AI teaming, plant biology, cell lineage"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full21","session_room":"None","session_title":"Model-checking and Validation","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Model-checking and Validation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T13:06:00Z","title":"Visualizing and Comparing Machine Learning Predictions to Improve Human-AI Teaming on the Example of Cell Lineage","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1026","abstract":"We present a visual analytics approach for multi-level visual exploration of users' interaction strategies in an interactive digital environment. The use of interactive touchscreen exhibits in informal learning environments, such as museums and science centers, often incorporate frameworks that classify learning processes, such as Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, to achieve better user engagement and knowledge transfer. To analyze user behavior within these digital environments, interaction logs are recorded to capture diverse exploration strategies. However, analysis of such logs is challenging, especially in terms of coupling interactions and cognitive learning processes, and existing work within learning and educational contexts remains limited. To address these gaps, we develop a visual analytics approach for analyzing interaction logs that supports exploration at the individual user level and multi-user comparison. The approach utilizes algorithmic methods to identify similarities in users' interactions and reveal their exploration strategies. We motivate and illustrate our approach through an application scenario, using event sequences derived from interaction log data in an experimental study conducted with science center visitors from diverse backgrounds and demographics. The study involves 14 users completing tasks of increasing complexity, designed to stimulate different levels of cognitive learning processes. We implement our approach in an interactive visual analytics prototype system, named VISID, and together with domain experts, discover a set of task-solving exploration strategies, such as \"cascading\" and \"nested-loop\", which reflect different levels of learning processes from Bloom's taxonomy. Finally, we discuss the generalizability and scalability of the presented system and the need for further research with data acquired in the wild.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"peilin.yu@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Peilin Yu"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"aida.vitoria@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aida Nordman"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"marta.koc-januchta@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marta M.

Task abstractions can help us go beyond domain-specific details, but existing visualization task abstractions are insufficient for event sequence visual analytics because they primarily focus on multivariate datasets and often overlook automated analytical techniques. To address this gap, we propose a domain-agnostic multi-level task framework for event sequence analytics, derived from an analysis of 58 papers that present event sequence visualization systems. Our framework consists of four levels: objective, intent, strategy, and technique. Overall objectives identify the main goals of analysis. Intents comprises five high-level approaches adopted at each analysis step: augment data, simplify data, configure data, configure visualization, and manage provenance. Each intent is accomplished through a number of strategies, for instance, data simplification can be achieved through aggregation, summarization, or segmentation. Finally, each strategy can be implemented by a set of techniques depending on the input and output components. We further show that each technique can be expressed through a quartet of action-input-output-criteria. We demonstrate the framework\u2019s descriptive power through case studies and discuss its similarities and differences with previous event sequence task taxonomies.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, United States"],"email":"kzintas@umd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kazi Tasnim Zinat"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"ssakhamu@terpmail.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Saimadhav Naga Sakhamuri"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"achen151@terpmail.umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aaron Sun Chen"},{"affiliations":["University of Maryland, College Park, United States"],"email":"leozcliu@umd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhicheng Liu"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1642","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full22","session_room":"None","session_title":"Time and Sequences","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Time and Sequences"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:39:00Z","title":"A Multi-Level Task Framework for Event Sequence Analysis","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243358919","abstract":"We conduct two in-lab experiments (N=93) to evaluate the effectiveness of Gantt charts, extended Gantt charts, and stringline charts for visualizing fixed-order event sequence data.

Our two experiments focus on event sequences with a pre-defined, fixed order, and measure task error rates and completion time. The first experiment shows single sequences and assesses the three charts' performance in comparing event duration or gap. The second experiment shows multiple sequences and evaluates how well the charts reveal temporal patterns. The results suggest that when visualizing single fixed-order event sequences, 1) Gantt and extended Gantt charts lead to comparable error rates in the duration-comparing task; 2) Gantt charts exhibit either shorter or equal completion time than extended Gantt charts; 3) both Gantt and extended Gantt charts demonstrate shorter completion times than stringline charts; 4) however, stringline charts outperform the other two charts with fewer errors in the comparing task when event type counts are high. Additionally, when visualizing multiple point-based fixed-order event sequences, stringline charts require less time than Gantt charts for people to find temporal patterns. Based on these findings, we discuss design opportunities for visualizing fixed-order event sequences and discuss future avenues for optimizing these charts.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Junxiu Tang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fumeng Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiang Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yifang Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiayi Zhou"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiwen Cai"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lingyun Yu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3358919","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243358919","image_caption":"","keywords":["Gantt chart, stringline chart, Marey's graph, event sequence, empirical study"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full22","session_room":"None","session_title":"Time and Sequences","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Time and Sequences"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T15:03:00Z","title":"A Comparative Study on Fixed-order Event Sequence Visualizations: Gantt, Extended Gantt, and Stringline Charts","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243364388","abstract":"Seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL) is a powerful tool to explore time series data visually.

Besides these mathematical results and modeling aspects, we introduce visualization techniques that address the challenges of uncertainty visualization and the problem of visualizing highly correlated components of a decomposition. The global uncertainty propagation enables the time series visualization with STL-consistent samples, the exploration of correlation between and within decomposition's components, and the analysis of the impact of varying uncertainty. Finally, we show the usefulness of UASTL and the importance of uncertainty visualization with several examples.

First, TSEQs can be large with respect to both the number of sequences and events, often leading to millions of events. Second, domain experts need validated metrics and features to identify interesting patterns. Third, after identifying interesting patterns, domain experts contextualize the patterns to foster sensemaking. Finally, domain experts seek to reduce data complexity by data simplification and machine learning support. We present IVESA, a visual analytics approach for TSEQs. It supports the analysis of TSEQs at the granularities of sequences and events, supported with metrics and feature analysis tools.

This innovative approach combines the best of two conventional methods of displaying and manipulating spatial 3D data, enabling users to fluidly explore diverse visual forms using tailored interaction techniques. Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures---often at multiple spatial or semantic scales---across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction, including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof, to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement.

However, the inherent visual nature of the charts creates barriers for people with visual impairments to reap the associated benefits to the same extent as their sighted peers. While extant research has predominantly focused on understanding and addressing these barriers for blind screen reader users, the needs of low-vision screen magnifier users have been largely overlooked. In an interview study, almost all low-vision participants stated that it was challenging to interact with data charts on small screen devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though they could technically \u201csee\u201d the chart content. They ascribed these challenges mainly to the magnification induced loss of visual context that connected data points with each other and also with chart annotations, e.g., axis values. In this paper, we present a method that addresses this problem by automatically transforming charts that are typically non-interactive images into personalizable interactive charts which allow selective viewing of desired data points and preserve visual context as much as possible under screen enlargement. We evaluated our method in a usability study with 26 low-vision participants, who all performed a set of representative chart-related tasks under different study conditions. In the study, we observed that our method significantly improved the usability of charts over both the status quo screen magnifier and a state-of-the-art space compaction-based solution.

While prior research predominantly focuses on the needs of the visually impaired, our survey aims to broaden this scope by investigating accessible data representations across a more inclusive spectrum of disabilities. After conducting a systematic review of 152 accessible data representation papers from ACM and IEEE databases, we found that roughly 78% of existing articles center on vision impairments. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the remaining 22% of papers focused on underrepresented disability communities. We developed categorical dimensions based on accessibility, visualization, and human-computer interaction to classify the papers. These dimensions include the community of focus, issues addressed, contribution type, study methods, participants, data type, visualization type, and data domain. Our work redefines accessible data representations by illustrating their application for disabilities beyond those related to vision. Building on our literature review, we identify and discuss opportunities for future research in accessible data representations.

Previous work has shown that speech commands, alone or in combination with other input modalities, can support visual data exploration by individuals. However, it is still unknown whether and how speech commands can be used in collaboration, and for what tasks. To answer these questions, we developed a functioning prototype that we used as a technology probe. We conducted an in-depth exploratory study with 10 participant pairs to analyze their interaction choices, the interplay between the input modalities, and their collaboration. While touch was the most used modality, we found that participants preferred speech commands for global operations, used them for distant interaction, and that speech interaction contributed to the awareness of the partner\u2019s actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of using speech commands during collaboration was related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Regarding collaboration styles, participants interacted with speech equally often whether they were in loosely or closely coupled collaboration. While the partners stood closer to each other during close collaboration, they did not distance themselves to use speech commands.

Despite advancements in AI model accuracy, there is still a significant need among domain experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that align better with domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the high costs of experimentation. To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with two key components: 1) Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2) Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids experts in organizing and comparing predictions and interpretive paths across different granularities, uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. Facilitated by SLInterpreter, this framework ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration.

The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration, spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail ``data stories'' are exported in a standard video file format to establish a common baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client, implemented as a plugin.

In recent years, more and more researchers have explored many narrative structures for effective and attractive data storytelling. Meanwhile, the Hero's Journey provides a classic narrative framework specific to the Hero's story that has been adopted by various mediums. There are continuous discussions about applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages, sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants were invited to design data videos with and without our design space guidance, which was evaluated by two experts. Results show that our design space provides useful and practical guidance for data storytellers effectively creating data videos with the Hero's Journey.","authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"email":"zwei302@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Zheng Wei"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"xxubq@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xian Xu"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1333","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full25","session_room":"None","session_title":"Once Upon a Visualization","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Once Upon a Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T17:42:00Z","title":"Telling Data Stories with the Hero\u2019s Journey: Design Guidance for Creating Data Videos","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1425","abstract":"Comics are an effective method for sequential data-driven storytelling, especially for dynamic graphs\u2014graphs whose vertices and edges change over time.

The tool uses a newly developed hierarchical clustering algorithm to segment consecutive snapshots of dynamic graphs while preserving their chronological order. It also presents rich information on both individuals and communities extracted from dynamic graphs in multiple views, where users can explore dynamic graphs and choose what to tell in comics.

WonderFlow provides a structure-aware animation library designed to ease chart animation creation, enabling authors to apply pre-designed animation effects to common visualization components. Additionally, authors can preview and refine their data videos within the same system, without having to switch between different creation tools.

We asked participants to repeatedly perform four different tasks with four table representation conditions (plain tables, tables with zebra striping, tables with cell background color encoding cell value, and tables with in-cell bars with lengths encoding cell value). We analyzed completion time, error rate, gaze-tracking data, mouse movement and participant preferences. We found that color and bar encodings help for finding maximum values. For a more complex task (comparison of proportional differences) color and bar helped less than zebra striping. We also characterize typical human behavior for the four tasks. These findings inform the design of tables and research directions for improving presentation of data in tabular form.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"email":"yongfengji@uvic.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"YongFeng Ji"},{"affiliations":["University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"email":"cperin@uvic.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Charles Perin"},{"affiliations":["University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"email":"nacenta@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Miguel A Nacenta"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1288","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full26","session_room":"None","session_title":"Perception and Cognition","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Perception and Cognition"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T17:42:00Z","title":"The Effect of Visual Aids on Reading Numeric Data Tables","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1291","abstract":"Emotion is an important factor to consider when designing visualizations as it can impact the amount of trust viewers place in a visualization, how well they can retrieve information and understand the underlying data, and how much they engage with or connect to a visualization.

Such context awareness is particularly useful for ubiquitous and immersive analytics where knowing which embedded visualizations the user is looking at can be used to make visualizations react appropriately to the user\u2019s attention: for example, by highlighting data the user has not yet seen. We can separate the approach into three components: (1) measuring the user\u2019s gaze on a visualization and its parts; (2) tracking the user\u2019s attention over time; and (3) reactively modifying the visual representation based on the current attention metric. In this paper, we present two separate implementations of AAV: a 2D data-agnostic method for web-based visualizations that can use an embodied eyetracker to capture the user\u2019s gaze, and a 3D data-aware one that uses the stencil buffer to track the visibility of each individual mark in a visualization. Both methods provide similar mechanisms for accumulating attention over time and changing the appearance of marks in response. We also present results from a qualitative evaluation studying visual feedback and triggering mechanisms for capturing and revisualizing attention.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"email":"arvind@cs.au.dk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Arvind Srinivasan"},{"affiliations":["Aarhus University, Aarhus N, Denmark"],"email":"johannes@ellemose.eu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Johannes Ellemose"},{"affiliations":["Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom"],"email":"p.butcher@bangor.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Peter W.

This design decision may be due to the lack of relevance of vertical scaling in normal PDFs. In fact, as long as two normal PDFs have the same means and standard deviations (SDs), they can be scaled to occupy different amounts of vertical space while still remaining statistically identical. Because unfixed PDF height increases as SD decreases, visualization designers may find themselves tempted to vertically shrink low-SD PDFs to avoid occlusion or save white space in their figures. Although irregular vertical scaling has been explored in bar and line charts, the visualization community has yet to investigate how this visual manipulation may affect reader comparisons of PDFs. In this paper, we present two preregistered experiments (n = 600, n = 401) that systematically demonstrate that vertical scaling can lead to misinterpretations of PDFs. We also test visual interventions to mitigate misinterpretation. In some contexts, we find including a y-axis can help reduce this effect. Overall, we find that keeping vertical scaling consistent, and therefore maintaining equal pixel areas under PDF curves, results in the highest likelihood of accurate comparisons. Our findings provide insights into the impact of vertical scaling on PDFs, and reveal the complicated nature of proportional area comparisons.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"racquel.fygenson@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Racquel Fygenson"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lace M.

These limits dictate the maximum information our mind can process at once. We explore the issue of capacity limitation by testing competing theories that describe how the number of frames shown in a display, the scale of the frames, and time constraints impact user performance with small multiples of line charts in an energy grid scenario. In two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 141 and Experiment 2 n = 360) and a follow-up eye-tracking analysis (n=5),we found a linear decline in accuracy with increasing frames across seven tasks, which was not fully explained by differences in frame size, suggesting visual search challenges. Moreover, the studies demonstrate that highlighting specific frames can mitigate some visual search difficulties but, surprisingly, not eliminate them. This research offers insights into optimizing the utility of small multiples by aligning them with human limitations.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Helia Hosseinpour"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Laura E.

The identification and visualization of clusters in graphs enable insight discovery in many application areas, such as life sciences and social sciences. Force-directed graph layouts promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they bring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. At the same time, matrices can effectively show clusters when a suitable row/column ordering is applied, but are less appealing to untrained users not providing an intuitive node-link metaphor. It is thus worth exploring layouts combining the strengths of the node-link metaphor and node ordering. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and `sfdp'. The measured advantage is greater in case of low cluster separability and/or low compactness.

However, common analytics tasks are multifaceted, encompassing interactions among four key aspects: strength, function, structure, and content. Current node-link visualization designs may fall short, focusing narrowly on certain aspects and neglecting the holistic, dynamic nature of egocentric networks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpreadLine, a novel visualization framework designed to enable the visual exploration of egocentric networks from these four aspects at the microscopic level. Leveraging the intuitive appeal of storyline visualizations, SpreadLine adopts a storyline-based design to represent entities and their evolving relationships. We further encode essential topological information in the layout and condense the contextual information in a metro map metaphor, allowing for a more engaging and effective way to explore temporal and attribute-based information. To guide our work, with a thorough review of pertinent literature, we have distilled a task taxonomy that addresses the analytical needs specific to egocentric network exploration.  Acknowledging the diverse analytical requirements of users, SpreadLine offers customizable encodings to enable users to tailor the framework for their tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy and general applicability of SpreadLine through three diverse real-world case studies (disease surveillance, social media trends, and academic career evolution) and a usability study.

Well-known representations like node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices offer valuable insights, but their effectiveness relies on the ability to identify patterns in the underlying topological structure. Reordering strategies and layout algorithms play a vital role in the visualization process since the arrangement of nodes, edges, or cells influences the visibility of these patterns. The BioFabric visualization combines elements of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, leveraging the strengths of both, the visual clarity of node-link diagrams and the tabular organization of adjacency matrices.  A unique characteristic of BioFabric is the possibility to reorder nodes and edges separately.  This raises the question of which combination of layout algorithms best reveals certain patterns. In this paper, we discuss patterns and anti-patterns in BioFabric, such as staircases or escalators, relate them to already established patterns, and propose metrics to evaluate their quality. Based on these quality metrics, we compared combinations of well-established reordering techniques applied to BioFabric with a well-known benchmark data set. Our experiments indicate that the edge order has a stronger influence on revealing patterns than the node layout. The results show that the best combination for revealing staircases is a barycentric node layout, together with an edge order based on node indices and length.  Our research contributes a first building block for many promising future research directions, which we also share and discuss.

They are commonly used to display temporal data or hierarchical graphs. Previous research has demonstrated that minimizing edge crossings is the most important criterion to consider when looking to improve the readability of such graphs. While heuristic approaches exist for crossing minimization, we are interested in optimal approaches to the problem that prioritize human readability over computational scalability. We aim to improve the usefulness and applicability of such optimal methods by understanding and improving their scalability to larger graphs. This paper categorizes and evaluates the state-of-the-art linear programming formulations for exact crossing minimization and describes nine new and existing techniques that could plausibly accelerate the optimization algorithm. Through a computational evaluation, we explore each technique's effect on calculation time and how the techniques assist or inhibit one another, allowing researchers and practitioners to adapt them to the characteristics of their graphs. Our best-performing techniques yielded a median improvement of 2.5\u201317x depending on the solver used, giving us the capability to create optimal layouts faster and for larger graphs.

Empirical evidence about performance and preference for different visualization approaches is scattered over different studies, experimental settings, and tasks. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the dynamic network visualization design space in two evaluations. First, a controlled study assessing participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of network structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without the support of standard interaction methods. Second, the best-performing combinations from the first study are enhanced based on participants' feedback and evaluated in a heuristic-based qualitative study with visualization experts on a real-world network. Our results highlight node-link with animation and playback controls as the best-performing combination and the most preferred based on ratings.

To address this challenge, we present MoNetExplorer, a novel interactive visual analytics system that leverages temporal network motifs to provide recommendations for window sizes and support users in visually comparing different slicing results. MoNetExplorer provides a comprehensive analysis based on window size, including (1) a temporal overview to identify the structural information, (2) temporal network motif composition, and (3) node-link-diagram-based details to enable users to identify and understand structural patterns at various temporal resolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted a case study with network researchers using two real-world dynamic network datasets. Our case studies show that the system effectively supports users to gain valuable insights into the temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Seokweon Jung"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"DongHwa Shin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kiroong Choe"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3337396","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233337396","image_caption":"","keywords":["Visual analytics, Measurement, Size measurement, Windows, Time measurement, Data visualization, Task analysis, Visual analytics, Dynamic networks, Temporal network motifs, Interactive network slicing"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full27","session_room":"None","session_title":"Of Nodes and Networks","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Of Nodes and Networks"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T20:03:00Z","title":"A Visual Analytics System for Analyzing Dynamic Networks with Temporal Network Motifs","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1147","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 which support multimodal input (i.e., prompts containing images in addition to text) have immense potential to advance visualization research.

We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is the VILA bank of \u223c1,100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of the VILA pipeline, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people\u2019s ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; comparing it to the existing VLAT, VILA-VLAT shows moderate to high convergent validity (R = 0.70).

We asked students to verbally walk through their process of making sense of unfamiliar visualizations, and conducted a qualitative analysis of these walkthroughs.   Our qualitative analysis found that after taking a visualization course,   students engaged with visualizations in more sophisticated ways: they were more likely to exhibit design empathy by thinking critically about the tradeoffs behind why a chart was designed in a particular way, and were better able to deconstruct a chart to make sense of it. We also gave students a quantitative assessment of visualization literacy and found no evidence of scores improving after the class, likely because the test we used focused on a different set of skills than those emphasized in visualization classes.

These complex charts are prevalent in everyday life, and individuals who lack knowledge in data visualization may find them challenging to understand. This paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users with low data literacy understand complex visualizations. While previous studies focus on text interactions with users, we noticed that visual cues are also critical for interpreting charts. We introduce an LLM application that supports both text and visual interaction for guiding chart interpretation. Our study with 26 participants revealed that the in-situ support effectively assisted users in interpreting charts and enhanced learning by addressing specific chart-related questions and encouraging further exploration. Visual communication allowed participants to convey their interests straightforwardly, eliminating the need for textual descriptions. However, the LLM assistance led users to engage less with the system, resulting in fewer insights from the visualizations. This suggests that users, particularly those with lower data literacy and motivation, may have over-relied on the LLM agent. We discuss opportunities for deploying LLMs to enhance visualization literacy while emphasizing the need for a balanced approach.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kiroong Choe"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chaerin Lee"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiwon Song"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aeri Cho"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nam Wook Kim"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3413195","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243413195","image_caption":"","keywords":["Visualization literacy, Large language model, Visual communication"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full28","session_room":"None","session_title":"Human and Machine Visualization Literacy","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Human and Machine Visualization Literacy"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-18T12:30:00Z","title":"Enhancing Data Literacy On-demand: LLMs as Guides for Novices in Chart Interpretation","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1140","abstract":"Written language is a useful tool for non-visual creative activities like composing essays and planning searches. This paper investigates the integration of written language into the visualization design process.

Via an interview study of 24 working visualization designers, we first established that only a minority of participants systematically use writing  to aid in design. A second study with 15 visualization designers examined four different variants of written rudders: asking questions, stating conclusions, composing a narrative, and writing titles. Overall, participants had a positive reaction; designers recognized the benefits of explicitly writing down components of the design and indicated that they would use this approach in future design work.  More specifically, two approaches - writing questions and writing conclusions/takeaways - were seen as beneficial across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise mainly for the creation stage. Although concerns around potential bias during data exploration were raised, participants also discussed strategies to mitigate such concerns. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between language and visualization, and proposes a straightforward, lightweight addition to the visualization design process.","authors":[{"affiliations":["UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"chase_stokes@berkeley.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliations":["Self, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"clarahu@berkeley.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Clara Hu"},{"affiliations":["UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"hearst@berkeley.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marti Hearst"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1140","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full29","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visualization Design Methods","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visualization Design Methods"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T17:30:00Z","title":"\"It's a Good Idea to Put It Into Words\": Writing 'Rudders' in the Initial Stages of Visualization Design","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1342","abstract":"Genomics experts rely on visualization to extract and share insights from complex and large-scale datasets. Beyond off-the-shelf tools for data exploration, there is an increasing need for platforms that aid experts in authoring customized visualizations for both exploration and communication of insights. A variety of interactive techniques have been proposed for authoring data visualizations, such as template editing, shelf configuration, natural language input, and code editors. However, it remains unclear how genomics experts create visualizations and which techniques best support their visualization tasks and needs. To address this gap, we conducted two user studies with genomics researchers: (1) semi-structured interviews (n=20) to identify the tasks, user contexts, and current visualization authoring techniques and (2) an exploratory study (n=13) using visual probes to elicit users\u2019 intents and desired techniques when creating visualizations. Our contributions include (1) a characterization of how visualization authoring is currently utilized in genomics visualization, identifying limitations and benefits in light of common criteria for authoring tools, and (2) generalizable design implications for genomics visualization authoring tools based on our findings on task- and user-specific usefulness of authoring techniques.

Thematic maps pose a number of unique challenges for responsiveness, such as inflexible aspect ratios that do not easily adapt to varying screen dimensions, or densely clustered visual elements in urban areas becoming illegible at smaller scales. However, design guidance on how to best address these issues is currently lacking. We conducted design sessions with eight professional designers and developers of web-based thematic maps for information visualization. Participants were asked to redesign a given map for various screen sizes and aspect ratios and to describe their reasoning for when and how they adapted the design. We report general observations of practitioners\u2019 motivations, decision-making processes, and personal design frameworks. We then derive seven challenges commonly encountered in responsive maps, and 17 strategies to address them, such as repositioning elements, segmenting the map, or using alternative visualizations. We compile these challenges and strategies into an illustrated cheat sheet targeted at anyone designing or learning to design responsive maps.

While the effects of examples have been studied in other disciplines, such as web design or engineering, the results are not readily applicable to visualization due to inconsistencies in findings and challenges unique to visualization design. Towards bridging this gap, we conduct an exploratory experiment involving 32 data visualization designers focusing on the influence of five factors (timing, quantity, diversity, data topic similarity, and data schema similarity) on objectively measurable design outcomes (e.g., numbers of designs and idea transfers). Our quantitative analysis shows that when examples are introduced after initial brainstorming, designers curate examples with topics less similar to the dataset they are working on and produce more designs with a high variation in visualization components. Also, designers copy more ideas from examples with higher data schema similarities. Our qualitative analysis of participants\u2019 thought processes provides insights into why designers incorporate examples into their designs, revealing potential factors that have not been previously investigated.

Subsequently, we specify objects, visual marks, properties, and appearance, storing them in a gene. Lastly, we map data onto the flowpath, ensuring suitable morphisms. Alternative designs are created by exchanging values in the gene. For example, designs that share similar traits, are created by making small incremental changes to the gene. Our design methodology fosters the generation of diverse creative concepts, space-filling visualisations, and traditional formats like bar charts, circular plots and pie charts. Through our implementation we showcase the model in action. As an example application, we integrate the output visualisations onto a smartwatch and visualisation dashboards.

Participants reported mind wandering while viewing visualizations from a pre-labeled visualization database and then provided quantitative ratings of trust, engagement, and design quality, along with qualitative descriptions and short-term/long-term recall assessments. Results show that mind wandering negatively affects short-term visualization recall and various post-viewing measures, particularly for visualizations with little text annotation. Further, the type of mind wandering impacts engagement and emotional response. Mind wandering also functions as an intermediate process linking visualization design elements to  post-viewing measures, influencing how viewers engage with and interpret visual information over time.

Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields. The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions. Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks. In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions. Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software. We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution. First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods. Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support. Second, we accelerate critical point probability computations using a parallel implementation with the VTK-m library, which is platform portable. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of our implementation with the ParaView software system to demonstrate near-real-time results for real datasets.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"tushar.athawale@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tushar M.

Given an input scalar field f and a set of \u201csignal\u201d persistence pairs to maintain, our approaches produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of \u201cnon-signal\u201d pairs, while (ii) preserving the \u201csignal\u201d pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification approaches, our method is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our work enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our framework can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing.

This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every simplex in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features. Empirical results on analytic and simulation data demonstrate drastic improvements in running time, produce features similar to the current state-of-the-art, and show the application of simplification to large, complex flows","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"finkent@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tanner Finken"},{"affiliations":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France"],"email":"julien.tierny@sorbonne-universite.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Julien Tierny"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"josh@cs.arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Joshua A Levine"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1494","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full3","session_room":"None","session_title":"Flow, Topology, and Uncertainty","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Flow, Topology, and Uncertainty"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-18T12:42:00Z","title":"Localized Evaluation for Constructing Discrete Vector Fields","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1574","abstract":"The numerical extraction of vortex cores from time-dependent fluid flow attracted much attention over the past decades. A commonly agreed upon vortex definition remained elusive since a proper vortex core needs to satisfy two hard constraints: it must be objective and Lagrangian. Recent methods on objectivization met the first but not the second constraint, since there was no formal guarantee that the resulting vortex coreline is indeed a pathline of the fluid flow. In this paper, we propose the first vortex core definition that is both objective and Lagrangian. Our approach restricts observer motions to follow along pathlines, which reduces the degrees of freedoms: we only need to optimize for an observer rotation that makes the observed flow as steady as possible. This optimization succeeds along Lagrangian vortex corelines and will result in a non-zero time-partial everywhere else. By performing this optimization at each point of a spatial grid, we obtain a residual scalar field, which we call vortex deviation error. The local minima on the grid serve as seed points for a gradient descent optimization that delivers sub-voxel accurate corelines. The visualization of both 2D and 3D vortex cores is based on the separation of the movement of the vortex core and the swirling flow behavior around it. While the vortex core is represented by a pathline, the swirling motion around it is visualized by streamlines in the correct frame. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several 2D and 3D time-dependent vector fields.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliations":["University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"],"email":"theisel@ovgu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Holger Theisel"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1574","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full3","session_room":"None","session_title":"Flow, Topology, and Uncertainty","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Flow, Topology, and Uncertainty"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-18T12:30:00Z","title":"Objective Lagrangian Vortex Cores and their Visual Representations","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243350076","abstract":"Ensembles of contours arise in various applications like simulation, computer-aided design, and semantic segmentation. Uncovering ensemble patterns and analyzing individual members is a challenging task that suffers from clutter. Ensemble statistical summarization can alleviate this issue by permitting analyzing ensembles' distributional components like the mean and median, confidence intervals, and outliers. Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular non-parametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas F.

We conducted a qualitative experiment with 13 professional data scientists analyzing two datasets with Jupyter notebooks, collecting a rich dataset of interaction traces and think-aloud utterances. By qualitatively coding participant utterances, we introduce a formalism that describes EDA as a sequence of analysis states, where each state is comprised of either a representation an analyst constructs (e.g., the output of a data frame, an interactive visualization, etc.) or an observation the analyst makes (e.g., about missing data, the relationship between variables, etc.). By applying our formalism to our dataset, we identify that interactive visualizations, on average, lead to earlier and more complex insights about relationships between dataset attributes compared to static visualizations. Moreover, by calculating metrics such as revisit count and representational diversity, we uncover that some representations serve more as \"planning aids\" during EDA rather than tools strictly for hypothesis-answering. We show how these measures help identify other patterns of analysis behavior, such as the \"80-20 rule\", where a small subset of representations drove the majority of observations. Based on these findings, we offer design guidelines for interactive exploratory analysis tooling and reflect on future directions for studying the role that visualizations play in EDA.

However, existing research on script understanding primarily focuses on revealing the process of data transformations, lacking the ability to analyze the potential scope, i.e., the space of script inputs and outputs. Meanwhile, constructing input/output space during script analysis is challenging, as the wrangling scripts could be semantically complex and diverse, and the association between different data objects is intricate. To facilitate data workers in understanding the input and output space of wrangling scripts, we summarize ten types of constraints to express table space and build a mapping between data transformations and these constraints to guide the construction of the input/output for individual transformations. Then, we propose a constraint generation model for integrating table constraints across multiple transformations. Based on the model, we develop Ferry, an interactive system that extracts and visualizes the data constraints describing the input and output space of data wrangling scripts, thereby enabling users to grasp the high-level semantics of complex scripts and locate the origins of faulty data transformations. Besides, Ferry provides example input and output data to assist users in interpreting the extracted constraints and checking and resolving the conflicts between these constraints and any uploaded dataset.

Many of these tools have been designed through collaborations with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. However, the design, implementation, and practical use of these tools still rely on siloed approaches, resulting in bespoke applications that are difficult to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these tools undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts, typically treating them only as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, they lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, they tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers to cross-domain collaboration. To address these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine data preprocessing, management, and visualization stages while tracking the provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse set of usage scenarios targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access.

Given a graphic input and original label information, how to place labels to meet both geometric and aesthetic requirements is an open challenging problem. Geometry-wise, traditional rule-driven solutions struggle to capture the complex interactions between labels, let alone consider graphical/appearance content. In terms of aesthetics, training/evaluation data ideally require nontrivial effort and expertise in design, thus resulting in a lack of decent datasets for learning-based methods. To address the above challenges, we formulate the task with a graph representation, where nodes correspond to labels and edges to interactions between labels, and treat label placement as a node position prediction problem. With this novel representation, we design a Label Placement Graph Transformer (LPGT) to predict label positions. Specifically, edge-level attention, conditioned on node representations, is introduced to reveal potential relationships between labels. To integrate graphic/image information, we design a feature aligning strategy that extracts deep features for nodes and edges efficiently. Next, to address the dataset issue, we collect commercial illustrations with professionally designed label layouts from household appliance manuals, and annotate them with useful information to create a novel dataset named the Appliance Manual Illustration Labels (AMIL) dataset. In the thorough evaluation on AMIL, our LPGT solution achieves promising label placement performance compared with popular baselines.

Discursive patinas are made of overlaid visual marks (anchors), attached to textual comments with category labels, likes, and replies. By coloring and styling the anchors, a meta visualization emerges, showing what and where people comment and annotate the visualization. These patinas show regions of heavy discussions, recent commenting activity, and the distribution of questions, suggestions, or personal stories. We ran workshops with 90 students, domain experts, and visualization researchers to study how people use anchors to discuss visualizations and how patinas influence people's understanding of the discussion. Our results show that discursive patinas improve the ability to navigate discussions and guide people to comments that help understand, contextualize, or scrutinize the visualization. We discuss the potential of anchors and patinas to support discursive engagements, including critical readings of visualizations, design feedback, and feminist approaches to data visualization.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"tobias.kauer@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias Kauer"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"derya.akbaba@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Derya Akbaba"},{"affiliations":["University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"doerk@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marian D\u00f6rk"},{"affiliations":["Inria, Bordeaux, France","University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"email":"bbach@inf.ed.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Benjamin Bach"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1394","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full31","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visual Design: Sketching and Labeling","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visual Design: Sketching and Labeling"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T14:15:00Z","title":"Discursive Patinas: Anchoring Discussions in Data Visualizations","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1502","abstract":"Sketching is a common practice among visualization designers, and an approachable entry to visualizations for individuals, but moving from a sketch to a full fledged data visualization often requires throwing away the original sketch recreating it from scratch.

The reweighting relationships between validation samples and training samples are modeled as a bipartite graph. Based on this graph, a validation sample improvement method is developed to improve the quality of validation samples. Since the automatic improvement may not always be perfect, a co-cluster-based bipartite graph visualization is developed to illustrate the reweighting relationships and support the interactive adjustments to validation samples and reweighting results. The adjustments are converted into the constraints of the validation sample improvement method to further improve validation samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Reweighter in improving reweighting results through quantitative evaluation and two case studies.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yukai Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jing Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zheng Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lan-Zhe Guo"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yu-Feng Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3345340","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233345340","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full31","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visual Design: Sketching and Labeling","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visual Design: Sketching and Labeling"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T14:51:00Z","title":"Interactive Reweighting for Mitigating Label Quality Issues","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20243392476","abstract":"Areas of interest (AOIs) are well-established means of providing semantic information for visualizing, analyzing, and classifying gaze data.

However, due to point sparsity, lack of structure, irregular distribution, and acquisition-related inaccuracies, results of point cloud    visualization are often subject to visual complexity and ambiguity. In this regard, non-photorealistic rendering can improve visual communication by reducing the cognitive effort required to understand an image or scene and by directing attention to important features. In the last 20 years, this has been demonstrated by various non-photorealistic r  rendering approaches that were proposed to target point clouds specifically. However, they do not use a common language or structure for assessment which complicates comparison and selection. Further, recent developments regarding point cloud characteristics and processing, such as massive data size or web-based rendering are rarely  considered. To address these issues, we present a survey on non-photorealistic rendering approaches for point cloud visualization, providing an overview of the current state of research. We derive a structure for the assessment of approaches, proposing seven primary dimensions for the categorization regarding intended goals, data requirements, used techniques, and mode of operation. We then systematically assess corresponding approaches and utilize this classification to identify trends and research gaps, motivating future research in the development of effective non-photorealistic point cloud rendering methods.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ole Wegen"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Willy Scheibel"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthias Trapp"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Rico Richter"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"J\u00fcrgen D\u00f6llner"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3402610","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243402610","image_caption":"","keywords":["Point clouds, survey, non-photorealistic rendering"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full31","session_room":"None","session_title":"Visual Design: Sketching and Labeling","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Visual Design: Sketching and Labeling"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T14:39:00Z","title":"A Survey on Non-photorealistic Rendering Approaches for Point Cloud Visualization","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1189","abstract":"The information visualization research community commonly produces supporting software to demonstrate technical contributions to the field.

Such an assistant must be able to perceive the environment and actions, reason about the environment state in relation to a given task, and seamlessly interact with the task performer. These interactions typically involve an AR headset equipped with sensors which capture video, audio, and haptic feedback. Previous works have sought to facilitate the development of intelligent AR assistants by visualizing these sensor data streams in conjunction with the assistant's perception and reasoning model outputs. However, existing visual analytics systems do not focus on user modeling or include biometric data, and are only capable of visualizing a single task session for a single performer at a time. Moreover, they typically assume a task involves linear progression from one step to the next. We propose a visual analytics system that allows users to compare performance during multiple task sessions, focusing on non-linear tasks where different step sequences can lead to success. In particular, we design visualizations for understanding user behavior through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data as a proxy for perception, attention, and memory as well as corresponding motion data (acceleration, angular velocity, and gaze). We distill these insights into embedding representations that allow users to easily select groups of sessions with similar behaviors. We provide two case studies that demonstrate how to use these visualizations to gain insights about  task performance using data collected during helicopter copilot training tasks. Finally, we evaluate our approach by conducting an in-depth examination of a think-aloud experiment with five domain experts.","authors":[{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"s.castelo@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sonia Castelo Quispe"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"jlrulff@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jo\u00e3o Rulff"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"pss442@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Parikshit Solunke"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"erin.mcgowan@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Erin McGowan"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York CIty, United States"],"email":"guandewu@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guande Wu"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"iran@ccrma.stanford.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Iran Roman"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"rlopez@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Roque Lopez"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"bs3639@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bea Steers"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"qisun@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qi Sun"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"jpbello@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Juan Pablo Bello"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Redondo Beach, United States"],"email":"bradley.feest@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bradley S Feest"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman, Aurora, United States"],"email":"michael.middleton@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Middleton"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman, Falls Church, United States"],"email":"ryan.mckendrick@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ryan McKendrick"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"csilva@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Claudio Silva"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1833","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full4","session_room":"None","session_title":"The Toolboxes of Visualization","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["The Toolboxes of Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T17:54:00Z","title":"HuBar: A Visual Analytics Tool to Explore Human Behavior based on fNIRS in AR Guidance Systems","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20233261320","abstract":"In recent years, narrative visualization has gained much attention.

Furthermore, we identified key properties such as uncertainty, steering, visual stability, and real-time processing that are significantly different with progressive applications.

While several recent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory environments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored, mono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a versatile approach (supporting both triangulated domains and regular grids) for the support of topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct numbers of processes. While developing this extension, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. We describe an MPI extension of TTK\u2019s data structure for triangulation representation and traversal, a central component to the global performance and generality of TTK\u2019s topological implementations. We also introduce an intermediate interface between TTK and MPI, both at the global pipeline level, and at the fine-grain algorithmic level. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from 20% to 80% (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1536 cores). Finally, we provide a roadmap for the completion of TTK\u2019s MPI extension, along with generic recommendations for each algorithm communication category.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"E.

Nonetheless, creating accurately labeled medical texts of high quality is often a time-consuming task that requires specialized domain knowledge. Traditional methods for generating labeled data typically rely on rigid rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to new tasks. While recent machine learning (ML) methodologies have mitigated the manual labeling efforts, configuring models to align with specific research requirements can be challenging for labelers without technical expertise. Moreover, automated labeling techniques, such as transfer learning, face difficulties in in directly incorporating expert input, whereas semi-automated methods, like data programming, allow knowledge integration through rules or knowledge bases but may lack continuous result refinement throughout the entire labeling process. In this study, we present a collaborative human-ML teaming workflow that seamlessly integrates visual cluster analysis and active learning to assist domain experts in labeling medical text with high efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an innovative neural network model called the embedding network, which incorporates expert insights to generate task-specific embeddings for medical texts. We integrate the workflow and embedding network into a visual analytics tool named KMTLabeler, equipped with coordinated multi-level views and interactions. Two illustrative case studies, along with a controlled user study, provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of KMTLabeler in creating an efficient labeling environment for medical text classification.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"He Wang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Ouyang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuchen Wu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chang Jiang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lixia Jin"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuanwu Cao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quan Li"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3406387","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20243406387","image_caption":"","keywords":["Medical Text Labeling, Expert Knowledge, Embedding Network, Visual Cluster Analysis, Active Learning"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full4","session_room":"None","session_title":"The Toolboxes of Visualization","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["The Toolboxes of Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T17:30:00Z","title":"KMTLabeler: An Interactive Knowledge-Assisted Labeling Tool for Medical Text Classification","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1188","abstract":"Vortices and their analysis play a critical role in the understanding of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed \u201clayering\u201d. Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., \u03bb2), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"adeelz92@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adeel Zafar"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"zpoorsha@cougarnet.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zahra Poorshayegh"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"diyang@uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Di Yang"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"chengu@cs.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoning Chen"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1188","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full5","session_room":"None","session_title":"Topological Data Analysis","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Topological Data Analysis"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T15:00:00Z","title":"Topological Separation of Vortices","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1705","abstract":"Contour trees describe the topology of level sets in scalar fields and are widely used in topological data analysis and visualization.

However, effective use of these distributed structures in analysis and visualization requires subsequent computation of geometric properties and branch decomposition to support contour extraction and exploration. In this work, we introduce distributed algorithms for augmentation, hypersweeps, and branch decomposition that enable parallel computation of geometric properties, and support the use of distributed contour trees as query structures for scientific exploration.

Today's lossy compressors rarely consider preserving topologies such as Morse-Smale complexes, and the discrepancies in topology between original and decompressed datasets could potentially result in erroneous interpretations or even incorrect scientific conclusions. In this paper, we focus on preserving Morse-Smale segmentations in 2D/3D piecewise linear scalar fields, targeting the precise reconstruction of minimum/maximum labels induced by the integral line of each vertex. The key is to derive a series of edits during compression time. These edits are applied to the decompressed data, leading to an accurate reconstruction of segmentations while keeping the error within the prescribed error bound. To this end, we develop a workflow to fix extrema and integral lines alternatively until convergence within finite iterations. We accelerate each workflow component with shared-memory/GPU parallelism to make the performance practical for coupling with compressors. We demonstrate use cases with fluid dynamics, ocean, and cosmology application datasets with a significant acceleration with an NVIDIA A100 GPU.","authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"li.14025@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuxiao Li"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Riverside, Riverside, United States"],"email":"xlian007@ucr.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xin Liang"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bei Wang"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"qiu.722@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yongfeng Qiu"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"lyan@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lin Yan"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1793","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full5","session_room":"None","session_title":"Topological Data Analysis","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Topological Data Analysis"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T14:15:00Z","title":"MSz: An Efficient Parallel Algorithm for Correcting Morse-Smale Segmentations in Error-Bounded Lossy Compressors","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1803","abstract":"Scalar field comparison is a fundamental task in scientific visualization. In topological data analysis, we compare topological descriptors of scalar fields---such as persistence diagrams and merge trees---because they provide succinct and robust abstract representations. Several similarity measures for topological descriptors seem to be both asymptotically and practically efficient with polynomial time algorithms, but they do not scale well when handling large-scale, time-varying scientific data and ensembles. In this paper, we propose a new framework to facilitate the comparative analysis of merge trees, inspired by tools from locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH hashes similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability. We propose two new similarity measures for merge trees that can be computed via LSH, using new extensions to Recursive MinHash and subpath signature, respectively. Our similarity measures are extremely efficient to compute and closely resemble the results of existing measures such as merge tree edit distance or geometric interleaving distance. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our LSH framework in applications such as shape matching, clustering, key event detection, and ensemble summarization.

In contrast to traditional auto-encoders which operate on vectorized data, our formulation explicitly manipulates merge trees on their associated metric space at each layer of the network, resulting in superior accuracy and interpretability. Our novel neural network approach can be interpreted as a non-linear generalization of previous linear attempts [79] at merge tree encoding. It also trivially extends to persistence diagrams.

Second, we document an application to dimensionality reduction, by exploiting the latent space of our auto-encoder, for the visual analysis of ensemble data. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by introducing two penalty terms, to help preserve in the latent space both the Wasserstein distances between merge trees, as well as their clusters.

We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy.

In practice, when viewers are confronted with embedded visualizations, they often have to focus on a primary task and can only quickly glance at a visualization showing rich, often dynamically updated, information. As such, the visualizations must be designed so as not to distract from the primary task, while at the same time being readable and useful for aiding the primary task. For example, in games, players who are engaged in a battle have to look at their enemies but also read the remaining health of their own game character from the health bar over their character's head. Many trade-offs are possible in the design of embedded visualizations in such dynamic scenarios, which we explore in-depth in this paper with a focus on user experience. We use video games as an example of an application context with a rich existing set of visualizations in motion. We begin our work with a systematic review of in-game visualizations in motion. Next, we conduct an empirical user study to investigate how different embedded visualizations in motion designs impact user experience.

We present two experiments implementing multiple fundamental aspects of motion such as type, speed, and synchronicity that can be used for numerical value encoding as well as comparing motion to static visual encodings in terms of user perception and accuracy. We studied how well users can assess the differences between several types of motion and static visual encodings and present an updated ranking of accuracy for quantitative judgments. Our results indicate that non-synchronized motion can be interpreted more quickly and more accurately than synchronized motion. Moreover, our ranking of static and motion visual representations shows that motion, especially expansion and translational types, has great potential as a data encoding technique for quantitative value. Finally, we discuss the implications for the use of animation and motion for numerical representations in data visualization.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shaghayegh Esmaeili"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Samia Kabir"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Anthony M.

Although moving visual representations attached to athletes or other targets are starting to appear, systematic investigations on how to best support their design process in the context of sports videos are still missing.

Our investigations include the analysis of a survey with swimming enthusiasts on their motion-related information needs, an ideation workshop to collect designs and elicit design challenges, the design of a technology probe that allows to create embedded visualizations in motion based on real data, and an evaluation with visualization designers that aimed to understand the benefits of designing directly on videos.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lijie Yao"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Romain Vuillemot"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Anastasia Bezerianos"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Petra Isenberg"}],"award":"","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3341990","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-tvcg-20233341990","image_caption":"","keywords":["Data visualization, Sports, Videos, Probes, Surveys, Authoring systems, Games, Design framework, Embedded visualization, Sports analytics, Visualization in motion"],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full6","session_room":"None","session_title":"Motion and Animated Notions","session_uid":"v-tvcg","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Motion and Animated Notions"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T19:51:00Z","title":"Designing for Visualization in Motion: Embedding Visualizations in Swimming Videos","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1272","abstract":"In various scientific and industrial domains, analyzing multivariate spatial data, i.e., vectors associated with spatial locations, is common practice. To analyze those datasets, analysts may turn to methods such as Spatial Blind Source Separation (SBSS). Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, SBSS finds latent components in the dataset and is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, when analysts try different tuning parameter settings, the amount of latent components complicates analytical tasks. Based on our years-long collaboration with SBSS researchers, we propose a visualization approach to tackle this challenge. The main component is UnDRground Tubes (UT), a general-purpose idiom combining ideas from set visualization and multidimensional projections. We describe the UT visualization pipeline and integrate UT into an interactive multiple-view system. We demonstrate its effectiveness through interviews with SBSS experts, a qualitative evaluation with visualization experts, and computational experiments. SBSS experts were excited about our approach. They saw many benefits for their work and potential applications for geostatistical data analysis more generally. UT was also well received by visualization experts. Our benchmarks show that UT projections and its heuristics are appropriate.","authors":[{"affiliations":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"email":"nikolaus.piccolotto@tuwien.ac.at","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Nikolaus Piccolotto"},{"affiliations":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"email":"mwallinger@ac.tuwien.ac.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Markus Wallinger"},{"affiliations":["Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"email":"miksch@ifs.tuwien.ac.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Silvia Miksch"},{"affiliations":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"email":"markus.boegl@tuwien.ac.at","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Markus B\u00f6gl"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1272","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full7","session_room":"None","session_title":"Dimensionality Reduction","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Dimensionality Reduction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T14:15:00Z","title":"UnDRground Tubes: Exploring Spatial Data With Multidimensional Projections and Set Visualization","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1568","abstract":"Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data.

Multi-dimensional partitionings occur, for example, when analyzing parameter spaces of simulation models, where each segment of the partitioning represents a region of similar model behavior. Having computed a partitioning, one is commonly interested in understanding how large the segments are and which segments lie next to each other. While visual representations of 2D domain partitionings that reveal sizes and neighborhoods are straightforward, this is no longer the case when considering multi-dimensional domains of three or more dimensions. We propose an algorithm for computing 2D embeddings of multi-dimensional partitionings. The embedding shall have the following properties: It shall maintain the topology of the partitioning and optimize the area sizes and joint boundary lengths of the embedded segments to match the respective sizes and lengths in the multi-dimensional domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to different use cases, including the visual exploration of 3D spatial domain segmentations and multi-dimensional parameter space partitionings of simulation ensembles. We numerically evaluate our algorithm with respect to how well sizes and lengths are preserved depending on the dimensionality of the domain and the number of segments.

Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE, address this challenge by projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important relationships. TopoMap is another technique that excels at preserving the underlying structure of the data, leading to interpretable visualizations. In particular, TopoMap maps the high-dimensional data into a visual space, guaranteeing that the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the visual space matches the one from the high-dimensional data. However, the original TopoMap algorithm can be slow and its layout can be too sparse for large and complex datasets. In this paper, we propose three improvements to TopoMap: 1) a more space-efficient layout, 2) a significantly faster implementation, and 3) a novel TreeMap-based representation that makes use of the topological hierarchy to aid the exploration of the projections.  These advancements make TopoMap, now referred to as TopoMap++, a more powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional data which we demonstrate through different use case scenarios.","authors":[{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"vitoriaguardieiro@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Vitoria Guardieiro"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"felipedeoliveira1407@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Felipe Inagaki de Oliveira"},{"affiliations":["Microsoft Research India, Bangalore, India"],"email":"harish.doraiswamy@microsoft.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Harish Doraiswamy"},{"affiliations":["University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, Brazil"],"email":"gnonato@icmc.usp.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"csilva@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Claudio Silva"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-full","event_title":"VIS Full Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1632","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"full7","session_room":"None","session_title":"Dimensionality Reduction","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Dimensionality Reduction"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T15:15:00Z","title":"TopoMap++: A faster and more space efficient technique to compute projections with topological guarantees","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-tvcg-20233324851","abstract":"Dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms are diverse and widely used for analyzing high-dimensional data.

Hyperbolic spaces have proven to be an important tool for embedding computations and analysis tasks as their non-linear nature lends itself well to tree or graph data. Subsequently, they have also been used in the visualization of high-dimensional data, where they exhibit increased embedding performance. However, none of the existing dimensionality reduction methods for embedding into hyperbolic spaces scale well with the size of the input data. That is because the embeddings are computed via iterative optimization schemes and the computation cost of every iteration is quadratic in the size of the input. Furthermore, due to the non-linear nature of hyperbolic spaces, Euclidean acceleration structures cannot directly be translated to the hyperbolic setting. This paper introduces the first acceleration structure for hyperbolic embeddings, building upon a polar quadtree. We compare our approach with existing methods and demonstrate that it computes embeddings of similar quality in significantly less time.

This proliferation has underscored the importance of expediting the deployment of charging infrastructure. Both academia and industry have thus devoted to addressing the charging station location problem (CSLP) to streamline this process. However, prevailing algorithms addressing CSLP are hampered by restrictive assumptions and computational overhead, leading to a dearth of comprehensive evaluations in the spatiotemporal dimensions. Consequently, their practical viability is restricted. Moreover, the placement of charging stations exerts a significant impact on both the road network and the power grid, which necessitates the evaluation of the potential post-deployment impacts on these interconnected networks holistically. In this study, we propose CSLens, a visual analytics system designed to inform charging station deployment decisions through the lens of coupled transportation and power networks. CSLens offers multiple visualizations and interactive features, empowering users to delve into the existing charging station layout, explore alternative deployment solutions, and assess the ensuring impact.

Specifically, we reconstruct a surface mesh from input flood simulation data and generate a to-scale 3D virtual scene by incorporating geographical data such as terrain, textures, buildings, and additional scene objects. To optimize computation and memory performance for large simulation datasets, we discretize the data on an adaptive grid using dynamic quadtrees and support level-of-detail based rendering. Moreover, to provide a perception of flooding direction for a time instance, we animate the surface mesh by synthesizing water waves. As interaction is key for effective decision-making and analysis, we introduce two novel techniques for flood visualization in immersive systems: (1) an automatic scene-navigation method using optimal camera viewpoints generated for marked points-of-interest based on the display layout, and (2) an AR-based focus+context technique using an aux display system. Submerse is developed in collaboration between computer scientists and atmospheric scientists. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system and application by conducting workshops with emergency managers, domain experts, and concerned stakeholders in the Stony Brook Reality Deck, an immersive gigapixel facility, to visualize a superstorm flooding scenario in New York City.","authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Saeed Boorboor"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yoonsang Kim"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ping Hu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Josef Moses"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Brian Colle"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Arie E.

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model\u2019s decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens, a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model\u2019s features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study.

Comparing multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but traditional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework for comparing embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts\u2014confusion, neighborhood, and relative size\u2014to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships. Informed by a preliminary user study, we implemented our framework using perceptual neighborhood graphs to define these regions and introduced metrics to quantify each concept.  We demonstrate the generality of our framework with usage scenarios from machine learning and single-cell biology, highlighting our metrics' ability to draw insightful comparisons across label hierarchies. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an evaluation study with five machine learning researchers and six single-cell biologists using an interactive and scalable prototype built with Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets.

These layouts result from a dimensionality reduction on the document-term matrix or a representation within a latent embedding, including topic models. Thereby, the resulting layout depends on the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction and is therefore affected by changes in them. Furthermore, the resulting layout is affected by changes in the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction. However, such changes to the layout require additional cognitive efforts from the user. In this work, we present a sensitivity study that analyzes the stability of these layouts concerning (1) changes in the text corpora, (2) changes in the hyperparameter, and (3) randomness in the initialization. Our approach has two stages: data measurement and data analysis. First, we derived layouts for the combination of three text corpora and six text embeddings and a grid-search-inspired hyperparameter selection of the dimensionality reductions. Afterward, we quantified the similarity of the layouts through ten metrics, concerning local and global structures and class separation. Second, we analyzed the resulting 42817 tabular data points in a descriptive statistical analysis.

We propose an algorithm that compensates for irregular sample distributions by a smooth transformation of the scatterplot's visual domain. Our algorithm evaluates the scatterplot's density distribution to compute a regularization mapping based on integral images of the rasterized density function. The mapping preserves the samples' neighborhood relations. Few regularization iterations suffice to achieve a nearly uniform sample distribution that efficiently uses the available screen space. We further propose approaches to visually convey the transformation that was applied to the scatterplot and compare them in a user study.

To address this limitation, we present Groot, a prototype system that allows users to proactively specify and refine automated data insights. The system allows users to directly manipulate chart elements to receive insight recommendations based on their selections. Additionally, Groot provides users with a manual editing interface to customize, reconfigure, or add new insights to individual charts and propagate them to future explorations.

Based on domain- or data-specific descriptors entered by the user, DaVE provides a list of appropriate visualization techniques, each accompanied by descriptions, examples, references, and resources. Sample code, adaptable container templates, and recipes for easy integration in HPC applications can be downloaded for easy access to high-fidelity visualizations. While the database is currently filled with a limited number of entries based on a broad evaluation of needs and challenges of current HPC users, DaVE is designed to be easily extended by experts from both the visualization and HPC communities.","authors":[{"affiliations":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"email":"koenen@informatik.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jens Koenen"},{"affiliations":["RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"email":"m.petersen@rptu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marvin Petersen"},{"affiliations":["RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"email":"garth@rptu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christoph Garth"},{"affiliations":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1130","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short1","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: System design","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: System design"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T19:15:00Z","title":"DaVE - A Curated Database of Visualization Examples","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1146","abstract":"Millions of runners rely on smart watches that display running-related metrics such as pace, heart rate and distance for training and racing\u2014mostly with text and numbers.

Many of their colleagues rely on data but are not themselves analysts; furthermore, their colleagues are reluctant or unable to use dedicated analytical applications or dashboards, and they expect communication to take place within threaded collaboration platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. In this paper, we introduce a set of six strategies for adapting content from business intelligence (BI) dashboards into appropriate formats for sharing on collaboration platforms, formats that we refer to as dashboard snapshots. Informed by prior studies of enterprise communication around data, these strategies go beyond redesigning or restyling by considering varying levels of data literacy across an organization, introducing affordances for self-service question-answering, and anticipating the post-sharing lifecycle of data artifacts. These strategies involve the use of templates that are matched to common communicative intents, serving to reduce the workload of data professionals. We contribute a formal representation of these strategies and demonstrate their applicability in a comprehensive enterprise communication scenario featuring multiple stakeholders that unfolds over the span of months.

While these approaches provide flexibility, they create a significant barrier to entry for non-experts and obscure the immediate impact of architectural decisions on model performance. In response to this challenge, recent no-code approaches have been developed with the aim of enabling easy model development through graphical interfaces. However, both traditional and no-code methodologies share a common limitation that the inability to predict model outcomes or identify issues without executing the model. To address this limitation, we introduce an intuitive visual feedback-based no-code approach to visualize and analyze deep learning models during the design phase. This approach utilizes dataflow-based visual programming with dynamic visual encoding of model architecture. A user study was conducted with deep learning developers to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the model design process, improving model understanding, and facilitating a more intuitive development experience. The findings of this study suggest that real-time architectural visualization significantly contributes to more efficient model development and a deeper understanding of model behaviors.","authors":[{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"juny0603@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"JunYoung Choi"},{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"wings159@vience.co.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sohee Park"},{"affiliations":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"hellenkoh@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"GaYeon Koh"},{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"k0seo0330@vience.co.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Youngseo Kim"},{"affiliations":["VIENCE Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"wkjeong@korea.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Won-Ki Jeong"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1047","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short3","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: AI and LLM","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: AI and LLM"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T19:51:00Z","title":"Intuitive Design of Deep Learning Models through Visual Feedback","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1058","abstract":"Semantic interaction (SI) in Dimension Reduction (DR) of images allows users to incorporate feedback through direct manipulation of the 2D positions of images.

Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 models can detect misleading visualizations with moderate accuracy without prior training (naive zero-shot) and that performance considerably improves by providing the model with the definitions of misleaders (guided zero-shot). Our results indicate that a single prompt engineering technique does not necessarily yield the best results for all types of misleaders.

Using zero-shot prompts, we instruct the models to provide responses or modify the SVG code based on given visualizations. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively modify existing SVG visualizations for some tasks like Cluster but perform poorly on tasks requiring mathematical operations like Compute Derived Value. We also discovered that LLM performance can vary based on factors such as the number of data points, the presence of value labels, and the chart type.

In this work, we investigate how such stochasticity affects the stability of projections and present a novel DR technique, GhostUMAP, to measure the pointwise instability of projections. Our idea is to introduce clones of data points, \u201cghosts\u201d, into UMAP\u2019s layout optimization process. Ghosts are designed to be completely passive: they do not affect any others but are influenced by attractive and repulsive forces from the original data points. After a single optimization run, GhostUMAP can capture the projection instability of data points by measuring the variance with the projected positions of their ghosts. We also present a successive halving technique to reduce the computation of GhostUMAP. Our results suggest that GhostUMAP can reveal unstable data points with a reasonable computational overhead.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Myeongwon Jung"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"takanori.fujiwara@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Takanori Fujiwara"},{"affiliations":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jmjo@skku.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jaemin Jo"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1065","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short4","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: Graph, Hierarchy and Multidinmensional","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: Graph, Hierarchy and Multidinmensional"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T13:24:00Z","title":"GhostUMAP: Measuring Pointwise Instability in Dimensionality Reduction","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1096","abstract":"Coordinated multiple views (CMV) in a visual analytics system can help users explore multiple data representations simultaneously with linked interactions.

We introduce use-coordination, a grammar and software library that supports the efficient implementation of CMV. The grammar defines a JSON-based representation for an abstract coordination model from the information visualization literature. We contribute an optional extension to the model and grammar that allows for hierarchical coordination. Through three use cases, we show that use-coordination enables implementation of CMV in systems containing not only basic statistical charts but also more complex visualizations such as medical imaging volumes. We describe six software extensions, including a graphical editor for manipulation of coordination, which showcase the potential to build upon our coordination-focused declarative approach.

In several applications, including biological workflows, chemical equations, and computational data flow analysis, these graphs often exhibit a tree-like nesting structure, where sibling clusters are disjoint. Common compound graph layouts prioritize the lowest level of the grouping, down to the individual ungrouped vertices, which can make the higher level grouped structures more difficult to discern, especially in deeply nested networks. Leveraging the additional structure of the tree-like nesting, we contribute an overview+detail layout for this class of compound graphs that preserves the saliency of the higher level network structure when groups are expanded to show internal nested structure. Our layout draws inner structures adjacent to their parents, using a modified tree layout to place substructures. We describe our algorithm and then present case studies demonstrating the layout's utility to a domain expert working on data flow analysis. Finally, we discuss network parameters and analysis situations in which our layout is well suited.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"hatch.on27@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Chang Han"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"lieffers@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Justin Lieffers"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"claytonm@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Clayton Morrison"},{"affiliations":["The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"kisaacs@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Katherine E.

In a user study with 18 participants, we found that our active label visualization modes can be comparable in visibility to a fixed green baseline by Gabbard et al., and can outperform it with added spatial variation in cluttered environments, across varying levels of lighting (e.g., nighttime), and in environments with colors similar to the fixed baseline color.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Brown University, Providence, United States"],"email":"hojung_kwon@brown.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hojung Kwon"},{"affiliations":["Brown University, Providence, United States"],"email":"yuanbo_li@brown.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuanbo Li"},{"affiliations":["Brown University, Providence, United States"],"email":"chloe_ye2019@hotmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiaohan Ye"},{"affiliations":["Brown University, Providence, United States"],"email":"praccho_muna-mcquay@brown.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Praccho Muna-McQuay"},{"affiliations":["Duke University, Durham, United States"],"email":"liuren.yin@duke.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Liuren Yin"},{"affiliations":["Brown University, Providence, United States"],"email":"james_tompkin@brown.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"James Tompkin"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1155","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short5","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: Scientific and Immersive Visualization","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: Scientific and Immersive Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T18:33:00Z","title":"Active Appearance and Spatial Variation Can Improve Visibility in Area Labels for Augmented Reality","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1183","abstract":"An atmospheric front is an imaginary surface that separates two distinct air masses and is commonly defined as the warm-air side of a frontal zone with high gradients of atmospheric temperature and humidity (Fig. 1, left). These fronts are a widely used conceptual model in meteorology, which are often encountered in the literature as two-dimensional (2D) front lines on surface analysis charts. This paper presents a method for computing three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric fronts as surfaces that is capable of extracting continuous and well-confined features suitable for 3D visual analysis, spatio- temporal tracking, and statistical analyses (Fig. 1, middle, right). Recently developed contour-based methods for 3D front extraction rely on computing the third derivative of a moist potential temperature field. Additionally, they require the field to be smoothed to obtain continuous large-scale structures. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative method to front extraction using ridge surface computation. The proposed method requires only the second derivative of the input field and produces accurate structures even from unsmoothed data. An application of the ridge-based method to a data set corresponding to Cyclone Friederike demonstrates its benefits and utility towards visual analysis of the full 3D structure of fronts.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"anne.gossing@fu-berlin.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anne Gossing"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christoph.fischer-1@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christoph Fischer"},{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"klenert@zib.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas Klenert"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"email":"vijayn@iisc.ac.in","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vijay Natarajan"},{"affiliations":["Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"george.pacey@fu-berlin.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"George Pacey"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"thorwin.vogt@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Thorwin Vogt"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"marc.rautenhaus@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marc Rautenhaus"},{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"baum@zib.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Baum"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1183","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short5","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: Scientific and Immersive Visualization","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: Scientific and Immersive Visualization"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T17:39:00Z","title":"A Ridge-based Approach for Extraction and Visualization of 3D Atmospheric Fronts","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1211","abstract":"Transfer function design is crucial in volume rendering, as it directly influences the visual representation and interpretation of volumetric data.

However, it remains challenging to assess how these models process charts. Existing benchmarks only roughly evaluate model performance without evaluating the underlying mechanisms, such as how models extract image embeddings. This limits our understanding of the model's ability to perceive fundamental graphical components. To address this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework to assess the graphical perception of image embedding models. For chart comprehension, we examine two main aspects of channel effectiveness: accuracy and discriminability of various visual channels. Channel accuracy is assessed through the linearity of embeddings, measuring how well the perceived magnitude aligns with the size of the stimulus. Discriminability is evaluated based on the distances between embeddings, indicating their distinctness. Our experiments with the CLIP model show that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and shows unique discriminability in channels like length, tilt, and curvature. We aim to develop this work into a broader benchmark for reliable visual encoders, enhancing models for precise chart comprehension and human-like perception in future applications.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"dtngus0111@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jangsus1@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Minsuk Chang"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"shpark@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Seokhyeon Park"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1072","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short6","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: Perception and Representation","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: Perception and Representation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T12:57:00Z","title":"Assessing Graphical Perception of Image Embedding Models using Channel Effectiveness","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1081","abstract":"Sine illusion happens when the more quickly changing pairs of lines lead to bigger underestimates of the delta between them.    We evaluate three visual manipulations on mitigating sine illusions: dotted lines, aligned gridlines, and offset gridlines via a user study.   We asked participants to compare the deltas between two lines at two time points and found aligned gridlines to be the most effective in mitigating sine illusions.    Using data from the user study, we produced a model that predicts the impact of the sine illusion in line charts by accounting for the ratio of the vertical distance between the two points of comparison.   When the ratio is less than 50\\%, participants begin to be influenced by the sine illusion. This effect can be significantly exacerbated when the difference between the two deltas falls under 30\\%.    We compared two explanations for the sine illusion based on our data: either participants were mistakenly using the perpendicular distance between the two lines to make their comparison (the perpendicular explanation), or they incorrectly relied on the length of the line segment perpendicular to the angle bisector of the bottom and top lines (the equal triangle explanation).

In a crowdsourced experiment, we find that participants can reliably characterize both statistics, although variance discrimination requires a much stronger signal. Multi-hue and diverging colormaps outperformed monochromatic, luminance ramps in aiding this extraction. Analysis of qualitative responses suggests that participants often estimate the distribution of hotspots and valleys as visual proxies for data statistics. These findings suggest that people's summary interpretation of spatial datasets is likely driven by the appearance of discrete color segments, rather than assessments of overall luminance. Implicit color segmentation in quantitative displays could thus prove more useful than previously assumed by facilitating quick, gist-level judgments about color-coded visualizations.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"vmateevitsi@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor A.

Additionally, we observed that the choice of contrast polarity can have an impact on time similar to that of the choice of visualization type, resulting in an average percent difference of around 36%. These findings indicate that, overall, the effects of contrast polarity on visual analysis performance do not noticeably change with age.

We demonstrate how Zoomable Level-of-Detail ChartTables - case-by-variable tables where cases are rows, variables are columns, variables are complex composite metrics that incorporate distributions, and cells contain mini-charts that depict these as different levels of detail through zoom interaction - help interpret whole distributions of model outputs to help understand the causes and effects of reactionary delay, how they inform timetable robustness testing, and how they could be used in other contexts.","authors":[{"affiliations":["City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliations":["Risk Solutions, Warrington, United Kingdom"],"email":"jonathan.hyde@risksol.co.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jonathan Hyde"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-short","event_title":"VIS Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-short-1301","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"short","paper_type_color":"#FDBB30","paper_type_name":"VIS Short Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"short6","session_room":"None","session_title":"Short Papers: Perception and Representation","session_uid":"v-short","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Short Papers: Perception and Representation"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-17T13:24:00Z","title":"Zoomable Level-of-Detail ChartTables for Interpreting Probabilistic Model Outputs for Reactionary Train Delays","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-short-1062","abstract":"Annotations are a critical component of visualizations, helping viewers interpret the visual representation and highlighting critical data insights.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an avenue to address these challenges, but their ability to extract the relevant semantic information remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four publicly available LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, Llama3, and Mixtral), investigating their ability to comprehend utterances even in the presence of uncertainty and identify the relevant data context and visual tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs are sensitive to uncertainties in utterances. Despite this sensitivity, they are able to extract the relevant data context. However, LLMs struggle with inferring visualization tasks. Based on these results, we highlight future research directions on using LLMs for visualization generation.

Prior research has identified five dimensions of trust assessment in visualizations (credibility, clarity, reliability, familiarity, and confidence), and observed that these dimensions tend to vary predictably along with certain features of the visualization being evaluated. This raises a further question: how do the design features driving viewers' trust assessment vary with the characteristics of the viewers themselves? By reanalyzing data from these studies through the lens of individual differences, we build a more detailed map of the relationships between design features, individual characteristics, and trust behaviors. In particular, we model the distinct contributions of endogenous design features (such as visualization type, or the use of color) and exogenous user characteristics (such as visualization literacy), as well as the interactions between them. We then use these findings to make recommendations for individualized and adaptive visualization design.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Smith College, Northampton, United States"],"email":"jcrouser@smith.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"R.

For massive and continuously growing streaming time series data, these data are typically visualized in the form of line charts, but the data transmission puts significant pressure on the network, leading to visualization lag or even failure to render completely. This paper proposes a universal sampling algorithm FPCS, which retains feature points from continuously received streaming time series data, compensates for the frequent fluctuating feature points, and aims to achieve efficient visualization. This algorithm bridges the gap in sampling for streaming time series data. The algorithm has several advantages: (1) It optimizes the sampling results by compensating for fewer feature points, retaining the visualization features of the original data very well, ensuring high-quality sampled data; (2) The execution time is the shortest compared to similar existing algorithms; (3) It has an almost negligible space overhead; (4) The data sampling process does not depend on the overall data; (5) This algorithm can be applied to infinite streaming data and finite static data.","authors":[{"affiliations":["China Nanhu Academy of Electronics and Information Technology(CNAEIT), JiaXing, China"],"email":"3271961659@qq.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hongyan Li"},{"affiliations":["China Nanhu Academy of Electronics and Information Technology(CNAEIT), JiaXing, China"],"email":"ustcboy@outlook.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bo Yang"},{"affiliations":["China Nanhu Academy of Electronics and Information Technology, Jiaxing, China"],"email":"caiyansong@cnaeit.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yansong Chua"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-virtual","event_title":"VIS Virtual Full and Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1363","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"virtual","session_room":"None","session_title":"Virtual: VIS from Around the World","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Virtual: VIS from Around the World"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T12:30:00Z","title":"FPCS: Feature Preserving Compensated Sampling of Streaming Time Series Data","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null},{"UID":"v-full-1500","abstract":"Haptic feedback provides an essential sensory stimulus crucial for interaction and analyzing three-dimensional spatio-temporal phenomena on surface visualizations. Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) catalyzes haptic interactions on surface visualizations. Various interaction modes, encompassing both mid-air and on-surface interactions---with or without the application of assisting force stimuli---have been explored using haptic force feedback devices. In this paper, we evaluate the use of on-surface and assisted on-surface haptic modes of interaction compared to a no-haptic interaction mode. A force-based haptic stylus is used for all three modalities; the on-surface mode uses collision based forces, whereas the assisted on-surface mode is accompanied by an additional snapping force. We conducted a within-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across all three modes, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took almost the same time to brush curves using all the interaction modes. They could draw smoother curves using the on-surface interaction modes compared to the no-haptic mode. However, the assisted on-surface mode provided better accuracy than the on-surface mode. The on-surface mode was slower in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant feedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share takeaways to aid the design of haptics-based tangible interactions for surface visualizations.

While advanced DNNs demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, understanding factors like prediction quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights aid application scientists in making informed decisions. However, DNNs lack inherent mechanisms to measure prediction uncertainty, prompting the creation of distinct frameworks for constructing robust uncertainty-aware models tailored to various visualization tasks. In this work, we develop uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model steady-state vector fields effectively. We comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, aimed at enabling uncertainty-informed visual analysis of features within steady vector field data. Our detailed exploration using several vector data sets indicate that uncertainty-aware models generate informative visualization results of vector field features. Furthermore, incorporating prediction uncertainty improves the resilience and interpretability of our DNN model, rendering it applicable for the analysis of non-trivial vector field data sets.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur , Kanpur, India"],"email":"atulkrfcb@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Atul Kumar"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur , Kanpur , India"],"email":"gsiddharth2209@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Siddharth Garg"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur), Kanpur, India"],"email":"soumya.cvpr@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Soumya Dutta"}],"award":"","doi":"","event_id":"v-virtual","event_title":"VIS Virtual Full and Short Papers","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_fno":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"v-full-1708","image_caption":"","keywords":[],"paper_type":"full","paper_type_color":"#1C3160","paper_type_name":"VIS Full Paper","prerecorded_video_id":null,"prerecorded_video_link":null,"session_bunny_ff_link":"","session_bunny_ff_subtitles":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_link":"","session_bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","session_id":"virtual","session_room":"None","session_title":"Virtual: VIS from Around the World","session_uid":"v-full","session_youtube_ff_id":"","session_youtube_ff_link":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_id":"","session_youtube_prerecorded_link":"","sessions":["Virtual: VIS from Around the World"],"time_stamp":"2024-10-16T12:42:00Z","title":"Uncertainty-Aware Deep Neural Representations for Visual Analysis of Vector Field Data","youtube_ff_id":null,"youtube_ff_url":null}]
