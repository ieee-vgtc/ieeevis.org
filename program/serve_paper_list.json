{"a-ldav-1002":{"abstract":"Cuneiform is the earliest known system of writing, first developed for the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia in the second half of the 4th millennium BC. Cuneiform signs are obtained by impressing a stylus on fresh clay tablets. For certain purposes, e.g. authentication by seal imprint, some cuneiform tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes, which cannot be opened without destroying them. The aim of our interdisciplinary project is the non-invasive study of clay tablets. A portable X-ray micro-CT scanner is developed to acquire density data of such artifacts on a high-resolution, regular 3D grid at collection sites. The resulting volume data is processed through feature-preserving denoising, extraction of high-accuracy surfaces using a manifold dual marching cubes algorithm and extraction of local features by enhanced curvature rendering and ambient occlusion. For the non-invasive study of cuneiform inscriptions, the tablet is virtually separated from its envelope by curvature-based segmentation. The computational- and data-intensive algorithms are optimized for near-real-time offline usage with limited resources at collection sites. To visualize the complexity-reduced and octree-based compressed representation of surfaces, we develop and implement an interactive application. To facilitate the analysis of such clay tablets, we implement shape-based feature extraction algorithms to enhance cuneiform recognition. Our workflow supports innovative 3D display and interaction techniques such as autostereoscopic displays and gesture control.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"stephan.olbrich@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Stephan Olbrich"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Nanterre, France"],"email":"cecile.michel@cnrs.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"C\u00e9cile Michel"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christian.schroer@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christian Schroer"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany","Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"samaneh.ehteram@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Samaneh Ehteram"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.schropp@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Schropp"},{"affiliations":["Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"philipp.paetzold@desy.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Philipp Paetzold"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Stephan Olbrich"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","slot_id":"a-ldav-1002","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Efficient Analysis and Visualization of High-Resolution Computed Tomography Data for the Exploration of Enclosed Cuneiform Tablets","uid":"a-ldav-1002","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"a-ldav-1003":{"abstract":"Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a well-established approach for the visualization of high-dimensional data sets. While DR methods are often applied to typical DR benchmark data sets in the literature, they might suffer from high runtime complexity and memory requirements, making them unsuitable for large data visualization especially in environments outside of high-performance computing. To perform DR on large data sets, we propose the use of out-of-sample extensions.  Such extensions allow inserting new data into existing projections, which we leverage to iteratively project data into a reference projection that consists only of a small manageable subset. This process makes it possible to perform DR out-of-core on large data, which would otherwise not be possible due to memory and runtime limitations. For metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), we contribute an implementation with out-of-sample projection capability since typical software libraries do not support it. We provide an evaluation of the projection quality of five common DR algorithms (MDS, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and autoencoders) using quality metrics from the literature and analyze the trade-off between the size of the reference set and projection quality. The runtime behavior of the algorithms is also quantified with respect to reference set size, out-of-sample batch size, and dimensionality of the data sets. Furthermore, we compare the out-of-sample approach to other recently introduced DR methods, such as PaCMAP and TriMAP, which claim to handle larger data sets than traditional approaches. To showcase the usefulness of DR on this large scale, we contribute a use case where we analyze ensembles of streamlines amounting to one billion projected instances.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"lucareichmann01@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Luca Marcel Reichmann"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"david.haegele@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"David H\u00e4gele"},{"affiliations":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Weiskopf"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["David H\u00e4gele"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","slot_id":"a-ldav-1003","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Out-of-Core Dimensionality Reduction for Large Data via Out-of-Sample Extensions","uid":"a-ldav-1003","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"a-ldav-1006":{"abstract":"Scientists generate petabytes of data daily to help uncover environmental trends or behaviors that are hard to predict. For example, understanding climate simulations based on the long-term average of temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables is essential to predicting and establishing root causes of future undesirable scenarios and assessing possible mitigation strategies. Unfortunately, bottlenecks in petascale workflows restrict scientists' ability to analyze and visualize the necessary information due to requirements for extensive computational resources, obstacles in data accessibility, and inefficient analysis algorithms. This paper presents an approach to managing, visualizing, and analyzing petabytes of data within a browser on equipment ranging from the top NASA supercomputer to commodity hardware like a laptop. Our approach is based on a novel data fabric abstraction layer that allows querying scientific information in a form that is user-friendly while hiding the complexities of dealing with file systems or cloud services. We also optimize network utilization while streaming from petascale repositories through state-of-the-art progressive compression algorithms. Based on this abstraction, we provide customizable dashboards that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, offering straightforward access to vast amounts of data typically not available to those without access to uniquely expensive hardware resources. Our dashboards provide and improve the ability to access and, more importantly, use massive data for a wide range of users, from top scientists with access to leadership-class computing environments to undergraduate students of disadvantaged backgrounds from minority-serving institutions. We focus on NASA's use of petascale climate datasets as an example of particular societal impact and, therefore, a case where achieving equity in science participation is critical. In particular, we validate our approach by improving the ability of climate scientist to explore their data even on the top NASA supercomputer, introducing the ability to study their data in a fully interactive environment instead of being limited to using pre-choreographed videos that can take days to generate each. We also successfully introduced the same dashboards and simplified training material in an undergraduate class on Geospatial Analysis in a minority-serving campus (Utah State Banding) with 69% of the Native American students and 86% being low-income. The same dashboards are also released in simplified form to the general public, providing an unparalleled democratization for the access and use of climate data that can be extended to most scientific domains.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"aashishpanta0@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Aashish Panta"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"xuanhuang@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xuan Huang"},{"affiliations":["NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, United States"],"email":"nina.mccurdy@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nina McCurdy"},{"affiliations":["NASA, mountain View, United States"],"email":"david.ellsworth@nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"David Ellsworth"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"amy.a.gooch@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Amy Gooch"},{"affiliations":["university of Utah, Salt lake city, United States"],"email":"scrgiorgio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Giorgio Scorzelli"},{"affiliations":["NASA, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"hector.torres.gutierrez@jpl.nasa.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hector Torres"},{"affiliations":["caltech, Pasadena, United States"],"email":"pklein@caltech.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Patrice Klein"},{"affiliations":["Utah State University Blanding, Blanding, United States"],"email":"gustavo.ovando@usu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gustavo Ovando-Montejo"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"pascucci.valerio@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Valerio Pascucci"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Aashish Panta"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"a-ldav0","slot_id":"a-ldav-1006","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Web-based Visualization and Analytics of Petascale data: Equity as a Tide that Lifts All Boats","uid":"a-ldav-1006","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"a-ldav-1011":{"abstract":"This paper describes the adaptation of a well-scaling parallel algorithm for computing Morse-Smale segmentations based on path compression to a distributed computational setting.

However, querying an encoded functional approximation is computationally expensive, especially when the input dataset is large, making functional approximation impractical for interactive visualization. In this paper, we proposed a novel functional approximation multi-resolution representation, Adaptive-FAM, which is lightweight and fast to query. We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multi-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the Adaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive responsiveness.

Yet, many public transport networks struggle to meet diverse user needs due to historical development, urban constraints, and financial limitations. Traditionally, planning of transport network structure is often based on limited surveys, expert opinions, or partial usage statistics. This provides an incomplete basis for decision-making. We introduce an data-driven approach to public transport planning and optimization, calculating detailed accessibility measures at the individual housing level. Our visual analytics workflow combines population-group-based simulations with dynamic infrastructure analysis, utilizing a scenario-based model to simulate daily travel patterns of varied demographic groups, including schoolchildren, students, workers, and pensioners. These population groups, each with unique mobility requirements and routines, interact with the transport system under different scenarios traveling to and from Points of Interest (POI), assessed through travel time calculations. Results are visualized through heatmaps, density maps, and network overlays, as well as detailed statistics. Our system allows us to analyze both the underlying data and simulation results on multiple levels of granularity, delivering both broad insights and granular details. Case studies with the city of Konstanz, Germany reveal key areas where public transport does not meet specific needs, confirmed through a formative user study. Due to the high cost of changing legacy networks, our analysis facilitates the identification of strategic enhancements, such as optimized schedules or rerouting, and few targeted stop relocations, highlighting consequential variations in accessibility to pinpointing critical service gaps. Our research advances urban transport analytics by providing policymakers and citizens with a system that delivers both broad insights with granular detail into public transport services for a data-driven quality assessment at housing-level detail.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"yannick.metz@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yannick Metz"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"dennis-fabian.ackermann@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dennis Ackermann"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"keim@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Keim"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"max.fischer@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Maximilian T.

We introduce three primary theories to conceptualize such influences: Recontextualization, Standardization, and Semantic Dementia, illustrating how LLMs drive, standardize, and potentially degrade language semantics.  Our subsequent review categorizes methods for visualizing semantic change into frequency-based, embedding-based, and context-based techniques, being first in assessing their effectiveness in capturing linguistic evolution: Embedding-based methods are highlighted as crucial for a detailed semantic analysis, reflecting both broad trends and specific linguistic changes. We underscore the need for novel visual, interactive tools to monitor and explain semantic changes induced by LLMs, ensuring the preservation of linguistic diversity and mitigating linguistic biases. This work provides essential insights for future research on semantic change visualization and the dynamic nature of language evolution in the times of LLMs.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"raphael.buchmueller@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Raphael Buchm\u00fcller"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"friederike.koerte@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Friederike K\u00f6rte"},{"affiliations":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"],"email":"keim@uni-konstanz.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Keim"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Raphael Buchm\u00fcller"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"associated","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"s-vds0","slot_id":"s-vds-1029","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Seeing the Shift: Keep an Eye on Semantic Changes in Times of LLMs","uid":"s-vds-1029","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-cga-10078374":{"abstract":"Existing dynamic weighted graph visualization approaches rely on users\u2019 mental comparison to perceive temporal evolution of dynamic weighted graphs, hindering users from effectively analyzing changes across multiple timeslices.

By collectively considering the overall temporal evolution and structure details in each timeslice, an optimization-based node reordering strategy is developed to group nodes with similar evolution patterns and highlight interesting graph structure details in each timeslice.

This is especially true for uncertain information, which is difficult for people to understand. Prior work has found that different methods of visualizing uncertain information can produce different patterns of decision making from users. However, uncertainty can also be represented via text or numerical information, and few studies have systematically compared these types of representations to visualizations of uncertainty. We present two experiments that compared visual representations of risk (icon arrays) to numerical representations (natural frequencies) in a wildfire evacuation task. Like prior studies, we found that different types of visual cues led to different patterns of decision making. In addition, our comparison of visual and numerical representations of risk found that people were more likely to evacuate when they saw visualizations than when they saw numerical representations. These experiments reinforce the idea that design choices are not neutral: seemingly minor differences in how information is represented can have important impacts on human risk perception and decision making.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"lematze@sandia.gov","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Laura E.

The use of interactive touchscreen exhibits in informal learning environments, such as museums and science centers, often incorporate frameworks that classify learning processes, such as Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, to achieve better user engagement and knowledge transfer. To analyze user behavior within these digital environments, interaction logs are recorded to capture diverse exploration strategies. However, analysis of such logs is challenging, especially in terms of coupling interactions and cognitive learning processes, and existing work within learning and educational contexts remains limited. To address these gaps, we develop a visual analytics approach for analyzing interaction logs that supports exploration at the individual user level and multi-user comparison.  The approach utilizes algorithmic methods to identify similarities in users' interactions and reveal their exploration strategies. We motivate and illustrate our approach through an application scenario, using event sequences derived from interaction log data in an experimental study conducted with science center visitors from diverse backgrounds and demographics. The study involves 14 users completing tasks of increasing complexity, designed to stimulate different levels of cognitive learning processes. We implement our approach in an interactive visual analytics prototype system, named VISID, and together with domain experts, discover a set of task-solving exploration strategies, such as \"cascading\" and \"nested-loop\", which reflect different levels of learning processes from Bloom's taxonomy.  Finally, we discuss the generalizability and scalability of the presented system and the need for further research with data acquired in the wild.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Media and Information Technology, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"peilin.yu@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Peilin Yu"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"aida.vitoria@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aida Nordman"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"marta.koc-januchta@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marta M.

To scout suitable players, coaches and analysts need to consider various complicated factors, such as the players' performance in the tactics of a new team, which is hard to learn directly from their historical performance. Match simulation methods have been introduced to scout players by estimating their expected contributions to a new team. However, they usually focus on the simulation of match results and hardly support interactive analysis to navigate potential target players and compare them in fine-grained simulated behaviors. In this work, we propose a visual analytics method to assist soccer player scouting based on match simulation. We construct a two-level match simulation framework for estimating both match results and player behaviors when a player comes to a new team. Based on the framework, we develop a visual analytics system, Team-Scouter, to facilitate the simulative-based soccer player scouting process through player navigation, comparison, and explanation. With our system, coaches and analysts can find potential players suitable for the team and compare them on historical and expected performances. To explain the players' expected performances, the system provides a visual comparison between the simulated behaviors of the player and the actual ones. The usefulness and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world dataset and an expert interview.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"caoanqi28@163.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anqi Cao"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"xxie@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiao Xie"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"2366385033@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Runjin Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"1282533692@qq.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuxin Tian"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"fanmu_032@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mu Fan"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"zhang_hui@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Anqi Cao"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1031","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Team-Scouter: Simulative Visual Analytics of Soccer Player Scouting","uid":"v-full-1031","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1032":{"abstract":"Dynamic topic modeling is useful at discovering the development and change in latent topics over time.

The relationship between each treatment decision and the potential tradeoff of tumor control and toxicity risk is poorly understood, leaving oncologists to largely rely on institutional knowledge and general guidelines that do not take into account specific patient circumstances. Evaluating these risks relies on a complicated understanding of several different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor spread and treatment side effect risk that can not be captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze nuanced patient risk for each patient and decide on an optimal treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several explainability methods to support clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our models. We evaluate the efficacy of our model through quantitative evaluation of model performance and case studies with qualitative feedback.

In this paper, we shift from the traditional focus on single-chart annotations to characterize the nuanced but crucial communication role of text in the complex environment of interactive dashboards. Through a survey and analysis of 190 dashboards in the wild, plus 13 expert interview sessions with experienced dashboard authors, we highlight the distinctive nature of text as an integral component of the dashboard experience, while delving into the categories, semantic levels, and functional roles of text, and exploring how these text elements are coalesced by dashboard authors to guide and inform dashboard users. Our contributions are threefold. First, we distill qualitative and quantitative findings from our studies to characterize current practices of text use in dashboards, including a categorization of text-based components and design patterns. Second, we leverage current practices and existing literature to propose, discuss, and validate recommended practices for text in dashboards, embodied as a set of 12 heuristics that underscore the semantic and functional role of text in offering navigational cues, contextualizing data insights, supporting reading order, among other concerns. Third, we reflect on our findings plus existing literature to identify gaps and propose opportunities for data visualization researchers to push the boundaries on text usage for dashboards, from authoring support and interactivity to text generation and content personalization. Our research underscores the significance of elevating text as a first-class citizen in data visualization, and the need to support the inclusion of textual components and their interactive affordances in dashboard design.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Tableau Research, Seattle, United States"],"email":"nicole.sultanum@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Nicole Sultanum"},{"affiliations":["Tableau Research, Palo Alto, United States"],"email":"vsetlur@tableau.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vidya Setlur"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Nicole Sultanum"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1060","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"From Instruction to Insight: Exploring the Semantic and Functional Roles of Text in Interactive Dashboards","uid":"v-full-1060","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1063":{"abstract":"While previous work has found success in deploying visualizations as museum exhibits, it has not investigated whether museum context impacts visitor behaviour with these exhibits.

Both sports fans and experts have a demand for analyzing sports tactics. Existing approaches allow users to visually perceive the multivariate tactical effects. However, these approaches usually consider each tactic as a whole, making it difficult for users to connect the complex interactions inside each tactic to the final tactical effect. In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs. Based on the framework, we design and develop Smartboard, an agent-based interactive visualization system for fine-grained tactical analysis. Smartboard provides users with a structured process of setup, simulation, and evolution, allowing for iterative exploration of tactics based on specific personalized scenarios. We conduct case studies based on real-world basketball datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of our system.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ziao_liu@outlook.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ziao Liu"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"xxie@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xiao Xie"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"3170101799@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Moqi He"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"zhao_ws@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wenshuo Zhao"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"wuyihong0606@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yihong Wu"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"lycheecheng@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Liqi Cheng"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"zhang_hui@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Ziao Liu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1099","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Smartboard: Visual Exploration of Team Tactics with LLM Agent","uid":"v-full-1099","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1100":{"abstract":"\u201cCorrelation does not imply causation\u201d is a famous mantra in statistical and visual analysis.

We collected a corpus of concept pairs from variables in widely used datasets and created visualizations that depict varying correlative associations using three typical statistical chart types. We conducted two MTurk studies on (1) preconceived notions on causal relations without charts, and (2) perceived causal relations with charts, for each concept pair. Our results indicate that people make assumptions about causal relationships between pairs of concepts even without seeing any visualized data. Moreover, our results suggest that these assumptions constitute causal priors that, in combination with chart type and visualized association, impact how data visualizations are interpreted. The results also suggest that causal priors may lead to over- or under-estimation in perceived causal relations in different circumstances, and that those priors can also impact users\u2019 confidence in their causal assessments. Using data from the studies, we develop a model to capture the interaction between causal priors and visualized associations as they combine to impact a user\u2019s perceived causal relations.

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jykim@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jaeyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"sihyeon@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sihyeon Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliations":["Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"gooday19@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Keon-Joo Lee"},{"affiliations":["Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin-si, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"bkim@hufs.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bohyoung Kim"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"braindoc@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"HEE JOON"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Jaeyoung Kim"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1121","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"PhenoFlow: A Human-LLM Driven Visual Analytics System for Exploring Large and Complex Stroke Datasets","uid":"v-full-1121","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1128":{"abstract":"Citations allow quickly identifying related research.

This paper presents the design and results of the first study to characterize human performance in 3D spatial data analysis tasks across analogous physical and digital visualizations. Participants analyzed continuous spatial elevation data with three visualization modalities: (1) 2D digital visualization; (2) perspective-tracked, stereoscopic \"fishtank\" virtual reality; and (3) 3D printed data physicalization. Their tasks included tracing paths downhill, looking up spatial locations and comparing their relative heights, and identifying and reporting the minimum and maximum heights within certain spatial regions. As hypothesized, in most cases, participants performed the tasks just as well or better in the physical modality (based on time and error metrics).

More specifically, two approaches \u2013- writing questions and writing conclusions/takeaways \u2013- were seen as beneficial across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise mainly for the creation stage.

This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs. Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations. In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"zhangzr32021@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zherui Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"yangf2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fan Yang"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"ranchengcn@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ran Cheng"},{"affiliations":["Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"email":"mayx@sustech.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuxin Ma"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yuxin Ma"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1179","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"ParetoTracker: Understanding Population Dynamics in Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms through Visual Analytics","uid":"v-full-1179","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1185":{"abstract":"This paper presents an interactive technique to explain visual patterns in network visualizations to analysts who are unfamiliar with these visualizations and who are learning to read them.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (\\ie, charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"xingchen.zeng@outlook.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xingchen Zeng"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"hlin386@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haichuan Lin"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China"],"email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yilin Ye"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"email":"weizeng@hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Wei Zeng"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Xingchen Zeng"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1193","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Advancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Chart Question Answering with Visualization-Referenced Instruction Tuning","uid":"v-full-1193","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1202":{"abstract":"The Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) is a metacognitive phenomenon where low-skilled individuals tend to overestimate their competence while high-skilled individuals tend to underestimate their competence.

The identification and visualization of clusters in graphs enable insight discovery in many application areas, such as life sciences and social sciences. Force-directed graph layout algorithms promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they generally bring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and, `sfdp'.

Given a graphic input and original label information, how to place labels to meet both geometric and aesthetic requirements is an open challenging problem. Geometry-wise, traditional rule-driven solutions struggle to capture the complex interactions between labels, let alone consider graphical/appearance content. In terms of aesthetics, training/evaluation data ideally require nontrivial effort and expertise in design, thus resulting in a lack of decent datasets for learning-based methods. To address the above challenges, we formulate the task with a graph representation, where nodes correspond to labels and edges to the between-label interactions, and treat label placement as a node position prediction problem. With this novel representation, we design a Label Placement Graph Transformer (LPGT) to predict label positions. Specifically, edge-level attention, conditioned on node representations, is introduced to reveal potential relationships between labels. To integrate graphic/image information, we design a feature aligning strategy that extracts deep features for nodes and edges efficiently. Next, to address the dataset issue, we collect commercial illustrations with professionally designed label layouts from household appliance manuals, and annotate them with useful information to create a novel dataset named the Appliance Manual Illustration Labels (AMIL) dataset. In the thorough evaluation on AMIL, our LPGT solution achieves promising label placement performance compared with popular baselines.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Southwest University, Beibei, China"],"email":"qujingwei@swu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jingwei Qu"},{"affiliations":["Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"email":"z2211973606@email.swu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pingshun Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Southwest University, Beibei, China"],"email":"enyuche@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Enyu Che"},{"affiliations":["COLLEGE OF COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, SOUTHWEST UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF SOFTWAREC, Chongqin, China"],"email":"out1147205215@outlook.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yinan Chen"},{"affiliations":["Stony Brook University, New York, United States"],"email":"hling@cs.stonybrook.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haibin Ling"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Jingwei Qu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1218","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Graph Transformer for Label Placement","uid":"v-full-1218","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1232":{"abstract":"How do cancer cells grow, divide, proliferate and die?

However, collecting this type of data and applying algorithms to segment and track cells and construct lineages of proliferation is error-prone; and identifying the errors can be challenging since it often requires cross-checking multiple data types. Similarly, analyzing and communicating the results necessitates synthesizing different data types into a single narrative. State-of-the-art visualization methods for such data use independent line charts, tree diagrams, and images in separate views. However, this spatial separation requires the viewer of these charts to combine the relevant pieces of data in memory.

In two experiments, we examine individuals' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Indiana University, Indianapolis, United States"],"email":"rkoonch@iu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ratanond Koonchanok"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States","University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, United States"],"email":"papka@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael E.

Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields. The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions. Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks. In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions. Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software. We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution. First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods. Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support. Second, we accelerate critical point probability computations using a parallel implementation with the VTK-m library, which is platform portable. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of our implementation with the ParaView software system to demonstrate near-real-time results for real datasets.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, United States"],"email":"tushar.athawale@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tushar M.

Current PB voting resembles a ballot where residents are asked which municipal projects, such as school improvements and road repairs, to fund with a limited budget. In this work, we ask how interactive visualization can benefit PB by conducting a design probe-based interview study (N=13) with policy workers and academics with expertise in PB, urban planning, and civic HCI. Our probe explores how graphical elicitation of voter preferences and a dashboard of voting statistics can be incorporated into a realistic PB tool. Through qualitative analysis, we find that visualization creates opportunities for city government to set expectations about budget constraints while also granting their constituents greater freedom to articulate a wider range of preferences. However, using visualization to provide transparency about PB requires efforts to mitigate potential access barriers and mistrust.

We asked participants to repeatedly perform four different tasks with tables in four table representation conditions (plain tables, tables with zebra striping, tables with cell background color encoding cell value, and tables with background bar length in a cell encoding cell value). We analyzed completion time, error rate, gaze-tracking data, mouse movement and participant preferences. We found that visual encodings help for finding maximum values (especially color), but not as much as zebra striping helps in a complex task (comparison of proportional differences). We also characterize typical human behavior for the different tasks.

However, it is still unknown whether and how speech commands can be used in collaboration, and for what tasks. To answer these questions, we developed a functioning prototype that we used as a technology probe. We conducted an in-depth exploratory study with 20 participants (10 pairs) to analyze their interaction choices, the interplay between the input modalities, and their collaboration. While touch was the most used modality, we found that participants preferred speech commands for global operations, used them for distant interaction, and that speech interaction contributed to the awareness of the partner\u2019s actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of using speech commands during collaboration was related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Regarding collaboration styles, participants interacted with speech equally often whether they were in loosely or closely coupled collaboration. While the partners stood closer to each other during close collaboration, they did not walk away from their partner to use speech commands.

At present, we lack tools and language for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g., infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains (biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science. This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex scientific concepts.

The advancement of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising direction for addressing this challenge. We explored the capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the impact of different prompting strategies on the models' analyses. We utilized a dataset of misleading charts collected from the internet by prior research and crafted nine distinct prompts, ranging from simple to complex, to test the ability of four different multimodal LLMs in detecting over 21 different chart issues. Through three experiments--from initial exploration to detailed analysis--we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs to identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the scalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the initial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and critical thinking in data interpretation. There is significant potential in employing multimodal LLMs to counter misleading information by supporting critical thinking and enhancing visualization literacy.

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. When tracking multiple objects across space and time, humans can typically track up to four objects, and the capacity is even lower if we also need to remember the history of the objects\u2019 features. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can increase processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control.

This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"ktang2@nd.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliations":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, United States"],"email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Kaiyuan Tang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1391","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"StyleRF-VolVis: Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields for Expressive Volume Visualization","uid":"v-full-1391","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1393":{"abstract":"This paper discusses challenges and design strategies in responsive design for thematic maps in information visualization.

In our visualization annotation interface, users can designate areas within the visualization to, e.g., highlight specific visual marks (anchors), attach textual comments, and add category labels, likes, and replies. By coloring and styling these designated areas, a meta visualization emerges, showing what and where people comment and annotate. These patinas show regions of heavy discussions, recent commenting activity, and the distribution of questions, suggestions, or personal stories. To study how people use anchors to discuss visualizations and understand if and how information in patinas influence people's understanding of the discussion, we ran workshops with 90 participants including students, domain experts, and visualization researchers. Our results show that discursive patinas improve the ability to navigate discussions and guide people to comments that help understand, contextualize, or scrutinize the visualization.

We have implemented the concept in a tool called D-TOUR PROTOTYPE that allows authors to craft custom and interactive dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically generated tours can still be customized to use different media (such as video, audio, or highlighting) or new narratives to produce a tailored onboarding experience for individual users or groups.

While the effects of examples have been studied in other disciplines, such as web design or engineering, the results are not readily applicable to visualization design due to inconsistencies in findings and challenges unique to visualization design. Towards bridging this gap, we conduct an exploratory experiment involving 32 data visualization designers focusing on the influence of five factors (timing, quantity, diversity, data topic similarity, and data schema similarity) on objectively measurable design outcomes (e.g., numbers of designs and idea transfers). Our quantitative analysis shows that when examples are introduced after initial brainstorming, designers curate examples with topics less similar to the dataset they are working on and produce more designs with a high variation in visualization components. Also, designers copy more ideas from examples with higher data schema similarities. Our qualitative analysis of participants\u2019 thought processes provides insights into why designers incorporate examples into their designs, revealing potential factors that have not been previously investigated. Finally, we discuss how our results inform future work on quantifying designs, improving measures of effectiveness, and supporting example-based visualization design.

For example, researchers of visualization literacy require large, diverse banks of items to conduct studies where the same skill is measured repeatedly on the same participants. Yet, generating a large number of high-quality, diverse items requires significant time and expertise. To address the critical need for a large number of diverse visualization items in education and research, this paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of multiple-choice visualization items. Through an iterative design process, we develop an LLM-based pipeline, the VILA (Visualization Items Generated by Large LAnguage Models) pipeline, for efficiently generating visualization items that measure people\u2019s ability to accomplish visualization tasks. We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is a final bank, the VILA bank, of \u223c1,100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of LLMs in generating visualization items, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people\u2019s ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; to show the potential of this application, we assess the convergent validity of VILA-VLAT by comparing it to the existing test VLAT via an online study (R = 0.70). Lastly, we discuss the application areas of the VILA pipeline and the VILA bank and provide practical recommendations for their use.

The emergence of deep learning in recent years has provided promising avenues for more efficient exploration of parameter spaces. However, existing approaches often lack intuitive methods for precise parameter adjustment and optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ParamsDrag, a model that facilitates parameter space exploration through direct interaction with visualizations. Inspired by DragGAN, our ParamsDrag model operates in three steps. First, the generative component of ParamsDrag generates visualizations based on the input simulation parameters. Second, by directly dragging structure-related features in the visualizations, users can intuitively understand the controlling effect of different parameters. Third, with the understanding from the earlier step, users can steer ParamsDrag to produce dynamic visual outcomes. Through experiments conducted on real-world simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches, we demonstrate the efficacy of our solution.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"email":"liguan@sccas.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Guan Li"},{"affiliations":["Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China"],"email":"leo_edumail@163.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yang Liu"},{"affiliations":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"email":"sgh@sccas.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guihua Shan"},{"affiliations":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"email":"chengshiyu@cnic.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Shiyu Cheng"},{"affiliations":["Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China"],"email":"weiqun.cao@126.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Weiqun Cao"},{"affiliations":["Visa Research, Palo Alto, United States"],"email":"junpeng.wang.nk@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Junpeng Wang"},{"affiliations":["National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei City, Taiwan"],"email":"caseywang777@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ko-Chih Wang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Guan Li"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1427","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"ParamsDrag: Interactive Parameter Space Exploration via Image-Space Dragging","uid":"v-full-1427","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1438":{"abstract":"Differential privacy ensures the security of individual privacy but poses challenges to data exploration processes because the limited privacy budget incapacitates the flexibility of exploration and the noisy feedback of data requests leads to confusing uncertainty.

In practice, when viewers are confronted with embedded visualizations, they often have to focus on a primary task and can only quickly glance at a visualization showing rich, often dynamically updated, information. As such, the visualizations must be designed so as not to distract from the primary task, while at the same time being readable and useful for aiding the primary task. For example, in games, players who are engaged in a battle have to look at their enemies but also read the remaining health of their own game character from the health bar over their character's head. Many trade-offs are possible in the design of embedded visualizations in such dynamic scenarios, which we explore in-depth in this paper with a focus on user experience. We use video games as an example of an application context with a rich existing set of visualizations in motion. We begin our work with a systematic review of in-game visualizations in motion. Next, we conduct an empirical user study to investigate how different embedded visualizations in motion designs impact user experience.

In contrast to pre-existing simplification approaches, our method is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our work enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our framework can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing.

However, prompt evaluation, especially at the dataset scale, remains complex due to the need to assess prompts across thousands of test instances within a dataset. Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation, focusing on text summarization. Our workflow advocates feature metrics such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the effectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks. For future works, we advocate moving towards feature-oriented evaluation of LLM prompts and discuss unsolved challenges in terms of human-agent interaction.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of California Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"ytlee@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"},{"affiliations":["University of California, Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"abahukhandi@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Aryaman Bahukhandi"},{"affiliations":["University of California at Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"dyuliu@ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dongyu Liu"},{"affiliations":["University of California at Davis, Davis, United States"],"email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Sam Yu-Te Lee"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1474","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Towards Dataset-scale and Feature-oriented Evaluation of Text Summarization in Large Language Model Prompts","uid":"v-full-1474","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1480":{"abstract":"We propose the notion of Attention-aware Visualizations (AAVs) that track the user's perception of a visual representation over time and feed this information back to the visualization.This idea is particularly useful for ubiquitous and immersive analytics where knowing which embedded visualizations the user is looking at can be used to make visualizations react appropriately to the user's attention: for example, by highlighting data the user has not yet seen. We can separate the approach into three components: (1) measuring the user's gaze on a visualization and its parts; (2) tracking the user's attention over time; and (3) reactively modifying the visual representation based on the current attention metric. In this paper, we present two separate implementations of AAV: a 2D numeric integration of attention for web-based visualizations that can use an embodied eye-tracker to capture the user's gaze, and a 3D implementation that uses the stencil buffer to track the visibility of each individual mark in a visualization. Both methods provide similar mechanisms for accumulating attention over time and changing the appearance of marks in response.

Our backstory began with developing a design space for two-party election forecasts, de\ufb01ning dimensions such as data transformations, visual channels, layouts, and types of animated narratives. We then qualitatively evaluated ten representative prototypes in this design space through interviews with 13 participants. The interviews yielded invaluable insights into how people interpret uncertainty visualizations and reason about probability in a U.S. election context, such as confounding win probability with vote share and erroneously forming connections between concrete visual representations (like dots) and real-world entities (like votes). Informed by these insights, we revised our prototypes to address ambiguity in interpreting visual encodings, particularly through the inclusion of extensive annotations. As we navigated these design paths, we contributed a design space and insights that may help others when designing uncertainty visualizations. We also hope that our design lessons and research process can inspire the research community when exploring topics related to designing visualizations for the general public.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"fumeng.p.yang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fumeng Yang"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States","Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"mandicai2028@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mandi Cai"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"chloemortenson2026@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chloe Rose Mortenson"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"hoda@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hoda Fakhari"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"aysedlokmanoglu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ayse Deniz Lokmanoglu"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"nicholas.diakopoulos@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicholas Diakopoulos"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Evanston, United States"],"email":"erik.nisbet@northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Erik Nisbet"},{"affiliations":["Northwestern University, Chicago, United States"],"email":"matthew.kay@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Matthew Kay"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fumeng Yang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1488","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"The Backstory to \u201cSwaying the Public\u201d: A Design Chronicle of Election Forecast Visualizations","uid":"v-full-1488","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1489":{"abstract":"Projecting high-dimensional vectors into two dimensions for visualization, known as embedding visualization, facilitates perceptual reasoning and interpretation. Comparison of multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but conventional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes embedding comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework to compare embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts---confusion, neighborhood, and relative size---to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships. Informed by a preliminary user study, we realize an implementation of our framework using perceptual neighborhood graphs to define these regions and introduce metrics to quantify each concept. We demonstrate the generality of our framework with use cases from machine learning and single-cell biology, highlighting our metrics' ability to surface insightful comparisons across label hierarchies. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study with five machine learning researchers and six single-cell biologists using an interactive and scalable prototype developed in Python and Rust.

One alternative is to represent the vector field using a discrete approach, which constructs a collection of pairs of simplices in the input mesh that satisfies criteria introduced by Forman\u2019s discrete Morse theory. While numerous approaches exist to compute pairs in the restricted case of the gradient of a scalar field, state-of-the-art algorithms for the general case of vector fields require expensive optimization procedures. This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every cell in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features. Empirical results on analytic and simulation data demonstrate drastic improvements in running time, produce features similar to the current state-of-the-art, and show the application of simplification to large, complex flows.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"finkent@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tanner Finken"},{"affiliations":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France"],"email":"julien.tierny@sorbonne-universite.fr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Julien Tierny"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"josh@cs.arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Joshua A Levine"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Tanner Finken"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1494","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Localized Evaluation for Constructing Discrete Vector Fields","uid":"v-full-1494","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1500":{"abstract":"Haptic feedback provides an essential sensory stimulus crucial for interacting and analyzing three-dimensional spatio-temporal phenomena on surface visualizations. Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) catalyzes haptic interactions on surface visualizations. Various interaction modes, encompassing both mid-air and on-surface interactions---with or without the application of assisting force stimuli---have been explored using haptic force feedback devices. In this paper, we evaluate the use of on-surface and assisted on-surface haptic modes of interaction compared to a no-haptic interaction mode. A force-based haptic stylus is used for all three modalities; the on-surface mode uses collision based forces, whereas the assisted on-surface mode is accompanied by an additional snapping force. We conducted a within-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across all three modes, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took almost the same time to brush curves using all the interaction modes. They could draw smoother curves using the on-surface interaction modes compared to the no-haptic mode. However, the assisted on-surface mode provided better accuracy than the on-surface mode. The on-surface mode was slower in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant feedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share takeaways to aid the design of haptics-based tangible interactions for surface visualizations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"email":"hamza.afzaal@ucalgary.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Hamza Afzaal"},{"affiliations":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"email":"ualim@ucalgary.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Usman Alim"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Hamza Afzaal"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1500","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Evaluating Force-based Haptics for Immersive Tangible Interactions with Surface Visualizations","uid":"v-full-1500","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1502":{"abstract":"Visualization is widely used for exploring personal data, but many visualization authoring systems do not support expressing data in flexible, personal, and organic layouts.

Our fitting begins with differentiable 3D rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates, followed by sampling the density values at its atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we propose a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. Such loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring both fitting accuracy and improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found its quality to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases. First, we demonstrate its use in the process of automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes. Second, we show that it facilitates the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in the identification of unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFitViewer) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as the spatial arrangement. In this work, we examine how well LLMs can predict such design choice sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We test four common chart arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked, through three experimental phases. In Phase I, we identified the optimal configuration of LLMs to generate meaningful chart takeaways, across three LLM models (GPT3.5, GPT4, GPT4V, and Gemini 1.0 Pro), two temperature settings (0, 0.7), four chart specifications (Vega-Lite, Matplotlib, ggplot2, and scene graphs), and several prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs can struggle to generate factually accurate takeaways. In Phase 2, using the most optimal LLM configuration, we generated 30 chart takeaways across the four arrangements of bar charts using two datasets, with both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to data on human takeaways from prior work, we found that the takeaways LLMs generate often do not align with human comparisons. In Phase 3, we examined the effect of the charts\u2019 underlying data values on takeaway alignment between humans and LLMs, and found both matches and mismatches. Overall, our work evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human-aligned chart takeaways.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Washington, Seattle, United States"],"email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Huichen Will Wang"},{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, Seattle, United States"],"email":"jhoffs@adobe.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jane Hoffswell"},{"affiliations":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, United States"],"email":"yukithane@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Sao Myat Thazin Thane"},{"affiliations":["Adobe Research, San Jose, United States"],"email":"victorbursztyn2022@u.northwestern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor S.

We conducted two empirical experiments to investigate individuals' ability to visually validate linear regression models (linear trends) and to examine the impact of common visualization designs on validation quality. The first experiment showed that the level of accuracy for visual estimation of slope (i.e., fitting a line to data) is higher than for visual validation of slope (i.e., accepting a shown line). Notably, we found bias toward slopes that are ''too steep'' in both cases. This lead to novel insights that participants naturally assessed regression with orthogonal distances between the points and the line (i.e., ODR regression) rather than the common vertical distances (OLS regression). In the second experiment, we investigated whether incorporating common designs for regression visualization (error lines, bounding boxes, and confidence intervals) would improve visual validation. Even though error lines reduced validation bias, results failed to show the desired improvements in accuracy for any design. Overall, our findings suggest caution in using visual model validation for linear trends in scatterplots.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"braun@cs.uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Daniel Braun"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"remco@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"affiliations":["University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, United States"],"email":"gleicher@cs.wisc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Gleicher"},{"affiliations":["University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"],"email":"landesberger@cs.uni-koeln.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tatiana von Landesberger"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Daniel Braun"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1547","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Beware of Validation by Eye: Visual Validation of Linear Trends in Scatterplots","uid":"v-full-1547","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1568":{"abstract":"Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data.

A commonly agreed upon vortex definition remained elusive since a proper vortex core needs to satisfy two hard constraints: it must be objective and Lagrangian. Recent methods on objectivization met the first but not the second constraint, since there was no formal guarantee that the resulting vortex coreline is indeed a pathline of the fluid flow. In this paper, we propose the first vortex core definition that is both objective and Lagrangian. Our approach restricts observer motions to follow along pathlines, which reduces the degrees of freedoms: we only need to optimize for an observer rotation that makes the observed flow as steady as possible. This optimization succeeds along Lagrangian vortex corelines and will result in a non-zero time-partial everywhere else. By performing this optimization at each point of a spatial grid, we obtain a residual scalar field, which we call vortex deviation error. The local minima on the grid serve as seed points for a gradient descent optimization that delivers sub-voxel accurate corelines. The visualization of both 2D and 3D vortex cores is based on the separation of the movement of the vortex core and the swirling flow behavior around it. While the vortex core is represented by a pathline, the swirling motion around it is visualized by streamlines in the correct frame. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several 2D and 3D time-dependent vector fields.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliations":["University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"],"email":"theisel@ovgu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Holger Theisel"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Tobias G\u00fcnther"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1574","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Objective Lagrangian Vortex Cores and their Visual Representations","uid":"v-full-1574","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1594":{"abstract":"The visualization community has a rich history of reflecting upon visualization design flaws.

Specifically, our approach involves partitioning a given large graph into multiple subgraphs, then clustering similar subgraphs and extracting similar structural information within each cluster. Subsequently, adaptive motifs representing each cluster are generated and utilized to replace the corresponding subgraphs, leading to a simplified visualization. Our approach aims to preserve as much information from the subgraphs as possible, effectively simplifying graphs while minimizing information loss.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to different use cases, including the visual exploration of 3D spatial domain segmentations and multi-dimensional parameter space partitionings of simulation ensembles.

Recent methods have focused on inferring interaction based on the proximity of cells in low-resolution 2D multi-channel imaging data. By contrast, we analyze cell interactions by quantifying the intensities of protein expressions extracted from high-resolution 3D multi-channel volume data. Such analyses have a strong exploratory nature and require a tight integration of domain experts in the analysis loop to leverage their deep knowledge. We propose two complementary semi-automated approaches to cope with the increasing size and complexity of the data in an interactive fashion: On the one hand, we interpret cell-to-cell interactions as edges in a cell graph and analyze the image signal (protein expressions) along those edges, using spatial as well as abstract data visualizations. Complementary, we propose a cell-centered approach, enabling scientists to visually analyze polarized distributions of proteins in three dimensions, which also captures neighboring cells with biochemical and cell biological consequences.

This innovative approach combines the best of two conventional methods of displaying and manipulating spatial 3D data, enabling users to fluidly explore diverse visual forms using tailored interaction techniques. Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures---often at multiple spatial or semantic scales---across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights. As a result, we provide our design suggestions for the cross-reality environment, emphasizing the interaction with diverse visual representations and seamless interaction transitions between 2D and 3D spaces.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"lixiang.zhao17@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lixiang Zhao"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Orsay, France","Inria, Saclay, France"],"email":"tobias.isenberg@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tobias Isenberg"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"fuqi.xie20@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fuqi Xie"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"hainingliang@hkust-gz.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hai-Ning Liang"},{"affiliations":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"email":"lingyun.yu@xjtlu.edu.cn","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Lingyun Yu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Lingyun Yu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1626","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"SpatialTouch: Exploring Spatial Data Visualizations in Cross-reality","uid":"v-full-1626","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1632":{"abstract":"High-dimensional data, characterized by many features, can be difficult to visualize effectively.

In particular, TopoMap maps the high-dimensional data into a visual space, guaranteeing that the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the visual space matches the one from the high-dimensional data. However, the original Topomap algorithm can be slow and its layout can be too sparse for large and complex datasets. In this paper, we propose three improvements to TopoMap: 1) a more space-efficient layout, 2) a significantly faster implementation, and 3) a novel treemap-based representation to aid the exploration of the projections.

This design decision may be due to the lack of relevance of vertical scaling in normal PDFs. In fact, as long as two normal PDFs have the same mean and standard deviations (SDs), they can be scaled to occupy different amounts of vertical space while still remaining statistically identical. Because unscaled PDF height increases as SD decreases, visualization designers may find themselves tempted to vertically shrink low-SD PDFs to avoid occlusion or save white space in their figures. While irregular vertical scaling has been explored in bar and line charts, the visualization community has yet to investigate how this purely visual manipulation may affect reader comparisons of PDFs. In this paper, we present two preregistered quantitative experiments (n=600, n=401) that systematically demonstrate that vertical scaling can lead to misinterpretations of PDFs. We also test visual interventions to mitigate misinterpretation. In some contexts, we find that including a y-axis reduces this effect. Overall, we find that keeping vertical scaling consistent, and therefore maintaining equal pixel areas under PDF curves, results in the highest likelihood of accurate comparisons. Our findings provide the first insights into the impact of vertical scaling on PDFs, and reveal the complicated nature of proportional area comparisons.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"racquel.fygenson@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Racquel Fygenson"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Boston, United States"],"email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lace M.

To address this gap, we propose a domain-agnostic multi-level task framework for event sequence analysis, derived from an analysis of 58 papers that present event sequence visualization systems. Our framework consists of four levels: objective, intent, strategy, and technique. Overall objectives identify the main goals of analysis. Intents comprises five high-level approaches adopted at each analysis step: augment data, simplify data, configure data, configure visualization, and create provenance. Each intent is accomplished through a number of strategies, for instance, data simplification can be achieved through aggregation, summarization, or segmentation. Finally, each strategy can be implemented by a set of techniques depending on the input and output components. We further show that techniques can be expressed through a quartet of action-input-output-criteria.

In this work, we introduce distributed algorithms for augmentation, hypersweeps, and branch decomposition that enable parallel computation of geometric properties, and support the use of distributed contour trees as a query structure for scientific exploration. We evaluate the parallel performance of these algorithms and apply them to identify and extract important contours for scientific visualization.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"mingzhefluorite@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Mingzhe Li"},{"affiliations":["University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom"],"email":"h.carr@leeds.ac.uk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hamish Carr"},{"affiliations":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"oruebel@lbl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Oliver R\u00fcbel"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bei Wang"},{"affiliations":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States"],"email":"ghweber@lbl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gunther H Weber"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Mingzhe Li"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1705","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Distributed Augmentation, Hypersweeps, and Branch Decomposition of Contour Trees for Scientific Exploration","uid":"v-full-1705","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1708":{"abstract":"The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently resulted in their application to challenging scientific visualization tasks.

However, existing research on script understanding primarily focuses on revealing the process of data transformations, lacking the ability to analyze the potential scope, i.e., the space of script inputs and outputs. Meanwhile, constructing input/output space during script analysis is challenging, as the wrangling scripts could be semantically complex and diverse, and the association between different data objects is intricate. To facilitate data workers in understanding the input and output spaces of wrangling scripts, we summarize ten types of constraints to express table spaces, and build a mapping between data transformations and these constraints to guide the construction of the input/output for individual transformations. Then, we propose a constraint generation model for integrating table constraints across multiple transformations. Based on the model, we develop Ferry, an interactive system that extracts and visualizes the data constraints describing the input and output spaces of data wrangling scripts, thereby enabling users to grasp the high-level semantics of complex scripts and locate the origins of faulty data transformations. Besides, Ferry provides example input and output data to assist users in interpreting the extracted constraints, checking and resolving the conflicts between these constraints and any uploaded dataset. Ferry's effectiveness and usability are evaluated via a usage scenario and two case studies: the first assists users in onboarding new data and debugging scripts, while the second verifies input-output compatibility across data processing modules. Furthermore, an illustrative application is presented to demonstrate Ferry's flexibility.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"rickyluozs@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Zhongsu Luo"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"kaixiong@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kai Xiong"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou,Zhejiang, China"],"email":"3220105578@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiajun Zhu"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"chenran928@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ran Chen"},{"affiliations":["Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom"],"email":"xinhuan.shu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xinhuan Shu"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China"],"email":"dweng@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Di Weng"},{"affiliations":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Zhongsu Luo"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1730","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Ferry: Toward Better Understanding of Input/Output Space for Data Wrangling Scripts","uid":"v-full-1730","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1738":{"abstract":"As a step towards improving visualization literacy, we investigated how students approach reading visualizations differently after taking a university-level visualization course.

Our qualitative analysis found changes in students' walkthroughs consistent with explicit learning goals of visualization courses. After taking a visualization course, students also engaged with visualizations in more sophisticated ways not fully captured by explicit learning goals: they were more likely to exhibit design empathy by thinking critically about the tradeoffs behind why a chart was designed in a particular way, and were better able to deconstruct a chart to make sense of it. We also gave students a quantitative assessment of visualization literacy and found no evidence of scores improving after the class,  likely because the test we used focused on a different set of skills than those emphasized in visualization classes.

In this paper, we focus on preserving Morse-Smale segmentations in 2D/3D piecewise linear scalar fields, targeting the precise reconstruction of minimum/maximum labels induced by the integral curve of each vertex. The key is to derive a series of edits during compression time; the edits are applied to the decompressed data, leading to an accurate reconstruction of segmentations while keeping the error within the prescribed error bound. To this end, we developed a workflow to fix extrema and integral curves alternatively until convergence within finite iterations; we accelerate each workflow component with shared-memory/GPU parallelism to make the performance practical for coupling with compressors.

Second, existing document visualization techniques cannot effectively display how the documents are relevant to users\u2019 interest, making it difficult for users to identify the most pertinent information. Third, existing embedding generation and visualization processes suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to understand, trust and use the result for decision-making.

VADIS introduces a prompt-based attention model (PAM) that generates dynamic document embedding and document relevance adjusted to the user's query. To effectively visualize these two pieces of information, we design a new document map that leverages a circular grid layout to display documents based on both their relevance to the query and the semantic similarity. Additionally, to improve the interpretability, we introduce a corpus-level attention visualization method to improve the user's understanding of the model focus and to enable the users to identify potential oversight. This visualization, in turn, empowers users to refine, update and introduce new queries, thereby facilitating a dynamic and iterative information-seeking experience.

The extent of the parameter space, the complexity of the non-linear model of the system, as well as the time needed per simulation run and factors that are not modeled in the simulation necessitate an iterative, semi-automatic approach. We present an interactive visual optimization approach, where the user works with a p-h diagram to steer an iterative, guided optimization process. A deep learning (DL) model provides estimates for parameters, given a target characterization of the system, while numerical simulation is used to predict system characteristics for an ensemble of parameter sets. Since the DL model only serves as an approximation of the inverse of the cooling system and since target characteristics can be chosen according to different, competing objectives, an iterative optimization process is realized, developing multiple sets of intermediate solutions, which are visually related to each other. The standard p-h diagram, integrated interactively in this approach, is complemented by a dual, also interactive visual representation of additional expressive measures representing the system characteristics. We show how the known four-points semantic of the p-h diagram meaningfully transfers to the dual data representation.

Well-known representations like node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices offer valuable insights, but their effectiveness relies on the ability to identify patterns in the underlying topological structure. Reordering strategies and layout algorithms play a vital role in the visualization process since the arrangement of nodes, edges, or cells influences the visibility of these patterns. The BioFabric visualization combines elements of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, leveraging the strengths of both, the visual clarity of node-link diagrams and the tabular organization of adjacency matrices. A unique characteristic of BioFabric is the possibility to reorder nodes and edges separately. This raises the question of which combination of layout algorithms best reveals certain patterns.  In this paper, we discuss patterns and anti-patterns in BioFabric, such as staircases or escalators, relate them to already established patterns, and propose metrics to evaluate their quality. Based on these quality metrics, we compared combinations of well-established reordering techniques applied to BioFabric with a well-known benchmark data set. Our experiments indicate that the edge order has a stronger influence on revealing patterns than the node layout. The results show that the best combination for revealing staircases is a barycentric node layout, together with an edge order based on node indices and length.

Many of these systems have been designed through engagement with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. The design, implementation, and practical use of these systems, however, still rely on siloed approaches that lead to bespoke tools that are hard to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these systems undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts by usually only treating them as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, these systems lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, these systems tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers for cross-domain collaboration. To tackle these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine preprocessing, managing, and visualization stages while tracking provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse series of use cases targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access. These cases use different types of urban data and domain methodologies to illustrate Curio's flexibility in tackling pressing societal challenges.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, United States"],"email":"gmorei3@uic.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gustavo Moreira"},{"affiliations":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Somerville, United States"],"email":"maryamh@mit.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Maryam Hosseini"},{"affiliations":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, United States"],"email":"carolinavfs@id.uff.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Carolina Veiga Ferreira de Souza"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, Brazil"],"email":"lucasalexandre.s.cc@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lucas Alexandre"},{"affiliations":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"email":"nicola.colaninno@polimi.it","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicola Colaninno"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niter\u00f3i, Brazil"],"email":"danielcmo@ic.uff.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel de Oliveira"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"email":"nivan@cin.ufpe.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nivan Ferreira"},{"affiliations":["Universidade Federal Fluminense , Niteroi, Brazil"],"email":"mlage@ic.uff.br","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marcos Lage"},{"affiliations":["University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, United States"],"email":"fabiom@uic.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Fabio Miranda"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Fabio Miranda"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1830","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Curio: A Dataflow-Based Framework for Collaborative Urban Visual Analytics","uid":"v-full-1830","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1831":{"abstract":"When using exploratory visual analysis to examine multivariate hierarchical data, users often need to query data to narrow down the scope of analysis.

Such an assistant must be able to perceive the performer\u2019s environment and actions, reason about the state of the environment in relation to a given task, and seamlessly interact with the performer. These interactions typically involve an AR headset equipped with a variety of sensors which capture video, audio, and haptic feedback. Previous works have sought to facilitate the development of such an assistant by visualizing these sensor data streams as well as the machine learning model outputs that support an assistant\u2019s perception and reasoning capabilities. However, existing visual analytics systems do not include biometric data or focus on user modeling, and are only capable of visualizing a single task session for a single performer at a time. Furthermore, they mainly focus on traditional task analysis that typically assumes a linear progression from one step to the next. We propose a visual analytics system that allows users to compare performance during multiple task sessions focusing on non-linear tasks where different paths or sequences can lead to the successful completion of the task. In particular, we design visualizations for understanding user behavior through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data as a proxy for perception, attention, and memory as well as corresponding motion data (acceleration, angular velocity, and eye gaze). We distill these insights into visual embeddings that allow users to easily select groups of sessions with similar behaviors. We provide case studies that explore how insights into task performance can be gleaned from these visualizations using data collected during helicopter copilot training tasks. Finally, we evaluate our approach by conducting an in-depth examination of a think-aloud experiment with five domain experts.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"s.castelo@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Sonia Castelo Quispe"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"jlrulff@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jo\u00e3o Rulff"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"pss442@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Parikshit Solunke"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"erin.mcgowan@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Erin McGowan"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York CIty, United States"],"email":"guandewu@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guande Wu"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"iran@ccrma.stanford.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Iran Roman"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"rlopez@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Roque Lopez"},{"affiliations":["New York University, Brooklyn, United States"],"email":"bs3639@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bea Steers"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"qisun@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Qi Sun"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York, United States"],"email":"jpbello@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Juan Pablo Bello"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Redondo Beach, United States"],"email":"bradley.feest@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bradley S Feest"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman, Aurora, United States"],"email":"michael.middleton@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Middleton"},{"affiliations":["Northrop Grumman, Falls Church, United States"],"email":"ryan.mckendrick@ngc.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ryan McKendrick"},{"affiliations":["New York University, New York City, United States"],"email":"csilva@nyu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Claudio Silva"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Sonia Castelo Quispe"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1833","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"HuBar: A Visual Analytics Tool to Explore Human Behaviour based on fNIRS in AR guidance systems","uid":"v-full-1833","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1836":{"abstract":"Shape is commonly used to distinguish between categories in multi-class scatterplots.

Although shapes can be a finite number compared to colors, they can not be represented by a numerical space, making it difficult to propose a general guideline for shape choices or shed light on the design heuristics of designer-crafted shape palettes. This paper presents a series of four experiments evaluating the efficiency of 39 shapes across three tasks -- relative mean judgment tasks, expert choices, and data correlation estimation. Given how complex and tangled results are, rather than relying on conventional features for modeling, we built a model and introduced a corresponding design tool that offers recommendations for shape encodings. The perceptual effectiveness of shapes significantly varies across specific pairs, and certain shapes may enhance perceptual efficiency and accuracy. However, how performance varies does not map well to classical features of shape such as angles, fill, or convex hull. We developed a model based on pairwise relations between shapes measured in our experiments and the number of shapes required to intelligently recommend shape palettes for a given design. This tool provides designers with agency over shape selection while incorporating empirical elements of perceptual performance captured in our study. Our model advances the understanding of shape perception in visualization contexts and provides practical design guidelines for advanced shape usage in visualization design that optimize perceptual efficiency.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"chint@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Chin Tseng"},{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliations":["University of Oklahoma, Norman, United States"],"email":"quadri@ou.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri"},{"affiliations":["University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States"],"email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Danielle Albers Szafir"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Chin Tseng"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1836","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"An Empirically Grounded Approach for Designing Shape Palettes","uid":"v-full-1836","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1865":{"abstract":"In medical diagnostics of both early disease detection and routine patient care, particle-based contamination of in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) consumables poses a significant threat to patients.

Our collaborators introduced us to their quality control process, including particle data acquisition through image recognition, feature extraction, and attributes reflecting the production context of particles.

As SRNs are black-box lossy data representations, assessing the prediction quality is critical for scientific visualization applications to ensure that scientists can trust the information being visualized.  Currently, existing architectures do not support inference time reconstruction quality assessment, as voxel-wise errors cannot be evaluated in the absence of ground truth data. By employing uncertain neural network architectures in feature grid SRNs, we obtain prediction variances during inference time to facilitate confidence-aware data reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-decoder Ensemble SRN (E-SRN) architecture consisting of a shared feature grid with multiple lightweight multi-layer perceptron decoders. E-SRN can generate a set of plausible predictions for a given input coordinate to compute the mean as the ensemble prediction and the variance as a confidence score. The voxel-wise variance can be rendered along with the data to inform the reconstruction quality, or be integrated into uncertainty-aware volume visualization algorithms. To prevent the misalignment between the quantified variance and the prediction quality, we propose a novel variance regularization loss for ensemble learning that promotes the Regularized Ensemble SRN (RE-SRN) to obtain a more reliable variance that correlates closely to the true model error. We comprehensively evaluate the quality of variance quantification and data reconstruction of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Mean Field Variational Inference (MFVI), Deep Ensemble (DE), and Predicting Variance (PV) in comparison with our proposed E-SRN and RE-SRN applied to state-of-the-art feature grid SRNs across diverse scalar field datasets. We demonstrate that RE-SRN attains the most accurate data reconstruction and competitive variance-error correlation among uncertain SRNs under the same neural network parameter budgets. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of uncertainty-aware volume rendering and shed light on the potential of incorporating uncertain predictions in improving the quality of volume rendering for uncertain SRNs. Through ablation studies on the regularization strength and ensemble size, we show that E-SRN and RE-SRN are expected to perform sufficiently well with a default configuration without requiring customized hyperparameter settings for different datasets.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"xiong.336@osu.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Tianyu Xiong"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States"],"email":"wurster.18@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Skylar Wolfgang Wurster"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States","Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tom Peterka"},{"affiliations":["The Ohio State University , Columbus , United States"],"email":"hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Tianyu Xiong"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"full0","slot_id":"v-full-1866","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Regularized Multi-Decoder Ensemble for an Error-Aware Scene Representation Network","uid":"v-full-1866","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-full-1874":{"abstract":"A layered network is an important category of graph in which every node is assigned to a layer and layers are drawn as parallel or radial lines.

While extant research has predominantly focused on understanding and addressing these barriers for blind screen reader users, the needs of low-vision screen magnifier users have been largely overlooked. In an interview study, almost all low-vision participants stated that it was challenging to interact with data charts on small screen devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though they could technically \u201csee\u201d the chart content.

A user study was conducted with deep learning developers to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the model design process, improving model understanding, and facilitating a more intuitive development experience.

Existing benchmarks only coarsely evaluate how well the model performs the given task without thoroughly evaluating the underlying mechanisms that drive performance, such as how models extract image embeddings. This gap limits our understanding of the model's perceptual capabilities regarding fundamental graphical components. Therefore, we introduce a novel evaluation framework designed to assess the graphical perception of image embedding models. In the context of chart comprehension, we examine two main aspects of channel effectiveness: accuracy and discriminability of various visual channels. We first assess channel accuracy through the linearity of embeddings, which is the degree to which the perceived magnitude is proportional to the size of the stimulus. % based on the assumption that perceived magnitude should be proportional to the size of Conversely, distances between embeddings serve as a measure of discriminability; embeddings that are far apart can be considered discriminable. Our experiments on a general image embedding model, CLIP, provided that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and demonstrated distinct discriminability in specific channels such as length, tilt, and curvature. We aim to extend our work as a more general benchmark for reliable visual encoders and enhance a model for two distinctive goals for future applications: precise chart comprehension and mimicking human perception.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"dtngus0111@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jangsus1@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Minsuk Chang"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"shpark@hcil.snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Seokhyeon Park"},{"affiliations":["Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of"],"email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Soohyun Lee"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"short0","slot_id":"v-short-1072","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Assessing Graphical Perception of Image Embedding Models using Channel Effectiveness","uid":"v-short-1072","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1078":{"abstract":"Data visualizations are reaching global audiences.

This has the potential to make color-coding more accessible and benefit more users. However, the importance of color choice, particularly in aiding textual information seeking through various color schemes, is not well studied. This paper presents a user study assessing the effectiveness of various color schemes generated by different base colors for readers' information-seeking performance in text documents color-coded by LLMs. Participants performed information-seeking tasks within scholarly papers' abstracts, each coded with a different scheme under time constraints. Results showed that non-analogous color schemes lead to better information-seeking performance, in both accuracy and response time. Yellow-inclusive color schemes lead to shorter response times and are also preferred by most participants. These could inform the better choice of color scheme for annotating text documents.

We investigate people's ability to estimate two summary statistics, mean and variance, from pseudocolor scalar fields. In a crowdsourced experiment, we find that participants can reliably characterize both statistics, although variance discrimination requires a much stronger signal. Multi-hue and diverging colormaps outperformed monochromatic, luminance ramps in aiding this extraction. Analysis of qualitative responses suggests that participants often estimate the distribution of hotspots and valleys as visual proxies for data statistics. These findings suggest that people's summary interpretation of spatial datasets is likely driven by the appearance of discrete color segments, rather than assessments of overall luminance. Implicit color segmentation in quantitative displays could thus prove more useful than previously assumed by facilitating quick, gist-level judgments about color-coded visualizations.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"vmateevitsi@anl.gov","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor A.

Based on domain- or data-specific descriptors entered by the user, DaVE provides a list of appropriate visualization techniques, each accompanied by descriptions, examples, references, and resources. Sample code, adaptable container templates, and recipes for easy integration in HPC applications can be downloaded for easy access to high-fidelity visualizations. While the database is currently filled with a limited number of entries based on a broad evaluation of needs and challenges of current HPC users, DaVE is designed to be easily extended by experts from both the visualization and HPC communities.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"email":"koenen@informatik.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jens Koenen"},{"affiliations":["RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"email":"m.petersen@rptu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marvin Petersen"},{"affiliations":["RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"email":"garth@rptu.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christoph Garth"},{"affiliations":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Jens Koenen"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"short0","slot_id":"v-short-1130","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"DaVE - A Curated Database of Visualization Examples","uid":"v-short-1130","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1135":{"abstract":"Humans struggle to perceive and interpret high-dimensional data. Therefore, high-dimensional data are often projected into two dimensions for visualization. Many applications benefit from complex nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, but the effects of individual high-dimensional features are hard to explain in the two-dimensional space. Most visualization solutions use multiple two-dimensional plots, each showing the effect of one high-dimensional feature in two dimensions; this approach creates a need for a visual inspection of k plots for a k-dimensional input space. Our solution, Feature Clock, provides a novel approach that eliminates the need to inspect these k plots to grasp the influence of original features on the data structure depicted in two dimensions.

These fronts are a widely used conceptual model in meteorology, which are often encountered in the literature as two-dimensional (2D) front lines on surface analysis charts. This paper presents a method for computing three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric fronts as surfaces that is capable of extracting continuous and well-confined features suitable for 3D visual analysis, spatio-temporal tracking, and statistical analyses. Recently developed contour-based methods for 3D front extraction rely on computing the third derivative of a moist potential temperature field. Additionally, they require the field to be smoothed to obtain continuous large-scale structures. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative method to front extraction using ridge surface computation. The proposed method requires only the sec- ond derivative of the input field and produces accurate structures even from unsmoothed data. An application of the ridge-based method to a data set corresponding to Cyclone Friederike demonstrates its benefits and utility towards visual analysis of the full 3D structure of fronts.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"anne.gossing@fu-berlin.de","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Anne Gossing"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"andreas.beckert@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andreas Beckert"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"christoph.fischer-1@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Christoph Fischer"},{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"klenert@zib.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas Klenert"},{"affiliations":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"email":"vijayn@iisc.ac.in","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Vijay Natarajan"},{"affiliations":["Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"george.pacey@fu-berlin.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"George Pacey"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"thorwin.vogt@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Thorwin Vogt"},{"affiliations":["Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"email":"marc.rautenhaus@uni-hamburg.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Marc Rautenhaus"},{"affiliations":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"email":"baum@zib.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Baum"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Anne Gossing"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"short0","slot_id":"v-short-1183","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"A Ridge-based Approach for Extraction and Visualization of 3D Atmospheric Fronts","uid":"v-short-1183","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1184":{"abstract":"To improve the perception of hierarchical structures in data sets, several color map generation algorithms have been proposed to take this structure into account.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for lowering barriers for users to achieve tasks such as writing code and may likewise facilitate visualization insight. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a text-based image format common in data visualizations, matches well with the text sequence processing of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we explore the capability of LLMs to perform 10 low-level visual analytic tasks defined by Amar, Eagan, and Stasko directly on SVG-based visualizations. Using zero-shot prompts, we instruct the models to provide responses or modify the SVG code based on given visualizations. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively modify existing SVG visualizations for some tasks like Cluster but perform poorly on tasks requiring mathematical operations like Compute Derived Value. We also discovered that LLM performance can vary based on factors such as the number of data points, the presence of value labels, and the chart type. Our findings contribute to gauging the general capabilities of LLMs and highlight the need for further exploration and development to fully harness their potential in supporting visual analytic tasks.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Brown University, Providence, United States"],"email":"leooooxzz@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Zhongzheng Xu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Zhongzheng Xu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"short0","slot_id":"v-short-1186","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Exploring the Capability of LLMs in Performing Low-Level Visual Analytic Tasks on SVG Data Visualizations","uid":"v-short-1186","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1188":{"abstract":"Vortices and their analysis play a critical role in the understanding of complex phenomena in turbulent flow.

In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed \u201clayering\u201d. Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., \u03bb2), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"adeelz92@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Adeel Zafar"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"zpoorsha@cougarnet.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zahra Poorshayegh"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"diyang@uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Di Yang"},{"affiliations":["University of Houston, Houston, United States"],"email":"chengu@cs.uh.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guoning Chen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Adeel Zafar"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"short0","slot_id":"v-short-1188","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Topological Separation of Vortices","uid":"v-short-1188","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1189":{"abstract":"The information visualization research community commonly produces supporting software to demonstrate technical contributions to the field.

To demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ, we conducted a qualitative study with five KG practitioners and distill their feedback. Our results indicate that practitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future LLM-assisted systems for the exploratory analysis of graph databases.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, United States"],"email":"harry.li@ll.mit.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Harry Li"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"gabriel.appleby@tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Gabriel Appleby"},{"affiliations":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, United States"],"email":"ashley.suh@ll.mit.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ashley Suh"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Harry Li"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"short","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"short0","slot_id":"v-short-1193","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"LinkQ: An LLM-Assisted Visual Interface for Knowledge Graph Question-Answering","uid":"v-short-1193","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1199":{"abstract":"In the digital landscape, the ubiquity of data visualizations in media underscores the necessity for accessibility to ensure inclusivity for all users, including those with visual impairments.

Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) for data visualization have explored ways to infer such information, yet challenges persist due to inherent uncertainty in human speech. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an avenue to address these challenges, but their ability to extract the relevant semantic information remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four publicly available LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, Llama3, and Mixtral), investigating their ability to comprehend utterances even in the presence of uncertainty and identify the relevant data context and visual tasks.

However, LLMs struggle with inferring visualization tasks. Based on these results, we highlight future research directions on using LLMs for visualization generation.

It breaks down typical analysis processes, such as linear regression and two-sample T-tests, into interactive steps supplemented with automatic visualizations and explanations for step-wise evaluation. Users can iterate on input choices to refine their models, while recommended actions and exports allow the user to continue their analysis in code.

Research from psychology suggests that comparisons involve multiple steps. First, the viewer divides the visualization into a set of units. This might include a single bar or a grouped set of bars. Then the viewer selects and compares two of these units, perhaps noting that one pair of bars is longer than another. Viewers might take an additional third step and perform a second-order comparison, perhaps determining that the difference between one pair of bars is greater than the difference between another pair. We create a visual comparison taxonomy that allows us to develop and test a sequence of hypotheses about which comparisons people are more likely to make when reading a visualization. We find that people tend to compare two groups before comparing two individual bars and that second-order comparisons are rare. Visual cues like spatial proximity and color can influence which elements are grouped together and selected for comparison, with spatial proximity being a stronger grouping cue. Interestingly, once the viewer grouped together and compared a set of bars, regardless of whether the group is formed by spatial proximity or color similarity, they no longer consider other possible groupings in their comparisons.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Andrew Lovett"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Steven Franconeri"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Cindy Xiong Bearfield"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3289292","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":["comparison, perception, visual grouping, bar charts, verbal conclusions."],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"tvcg0","slot_id":"v-tvcg-20233289292","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"What Does the Chart Say?

To speed up this tedious process, we make use of machine learning (ML) models trained on a database of manually established cell lineages to assist the biologist in cell assignment. Most biologists, however, are not familiar with ML, nor is it clear to them which model best predicts the embryo's development.

However, none of these existing methods can be directly applied to optimizing non-differentiable criteria without special accommodation. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning framework for graph drawing, called SmartGD, which can optimize any quantitative aesthetic goals even though they are non-differentiable. In the cases where the aesthetic goal is too abstract to be described mathematically, SmartGD can draw graphs in a similar style as a collection of good layout examples, which might be selected by humans based on the abstract aesthetic goal. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartGD, we conduct experiments on minimizing stress, minimizing edge crossing, maximizing crossing angle, and a combination of multiple aesthetics.

The embeddings of the entities and relations can be learned from dataset-visualization pairs. Also, AdaVis incorporates the attention mechanism into the inference framework.

However, quantum circuits, which are fundamental for implementing quantum algorithms, can be challenging for users to understand due to their underlying logic, such as the temporal evolution of quantum states and the effect of quantum amplitudes on the probability of basis quantum states. To fill this research gap, we propose QuantumEyes, an interactive visual analytics system to enhance the interpretability of quantum circuits through both global and local levels. For the global-level analysis, we present three coupled visualizations to delineate the changes of quantum states and the underlying reasons: a Probability Summary View to overview the probability evolution of quantum states; a State Evolution View to enable an in-depth analysis of the influence of quantum gates on the quantum states; a Gate Explanation View to show the individual qubit states and facilitate a better understanding of the effect of quantum gates.

We used two interface alternatives featuring contrasting approaches to the data preparation and analysis workflow: manual file-based ex-situ integration as a separate step from visual analytics operations; and automatic UI-based in-situ integration merged with visual analytics operations. Participants were asked to complete specific and free-form tasks with each interface, browsing for patterns, generating insights, and summarizing relationships between attributes distributed across multiple files. Analyzing participants' interactions and feedback, we found both task completion time and total interactions to be similar across interfaces and tasks, as well as unique integration strategies between interfaces and emergent behaviors related to satisficing and cognitive bias. Participants' time spent and interactions revealed that in-situ integration enabled users to spend more time on analysis tasks compared with ex-situ integration.

In contrast to traditional auto-encoders which operate on vectorized data, our formulation explicitly manipulates merge trees on their associated metric space at each layer of the network, resulting in superior accuracy and interpretability. Our novel neural network approach can be interpreted as a non-linear generalization of previous linear attempts [79] at merge tree encoding. It also trivially extends to persistence diagrams. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms, with MT-WAE computations in the orders of minutes on average. We show the utility of our contributions in two applications adapted from previous work on merge tree encoding [79]. First, we apply MT-WAE to merge tree compression, by concisely representing them with their coordinates in the final layer of our auto-encoder. Second, we document an application to dimensionality reduction, by exploiting the latent space of our auto-encoder, for the visual analysis of ensemble data. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by introducing two penalty terms, to help preserve in the latent space both the Wasserstein distances between merge trees, as well as their clusters. In both applications, quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework.

Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms \u201c judgment \u201d and \u201c decision making \u201d are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence people's judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.

Progressive visualizations can be categorized by well-known visualization taxonomies, but we also found that progressive visualizations can be distinguished by the way they manage their data processing, data domain, and visual update. Furthermore, we identified key properties such as uncertainty, steering, visual stability, and real-time processing that are significantly different with progressive applications.

Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular non-parametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicolas F.

We hypothesized that eliciting prior beliefs leads to more elaborative thinking that ultimately results in higher attitude change, better recall, and engagement. Our findings revealed that visual elicitation leads to higher engagement in terms of feelings of surprise. While there is an overall attitude change across all experiment conditions, we did not observe a significant effect of belief elicitation on attitude change. With regard to recall error, while participants in the draw trend elicitation exhibited significantly lower recall error than participants in the categorize trend condition, we found no significant difference in recall error when comparing elicitation conditions to no elicitation. In a follow-up study, we added contrasting narratives with the purpose of making the main visualization (communicating data on the focal issue) appear strikingly different. Compared to the results of Study 1, we found that contrasting narratives improved engagement in terms of surprise and interest but interestingly resulted in higher recall error and no significant change in attitude.

Recently, range analysis has shown promising results in improving the efficiency of geometric queries, such as ray casting and hierarchical mesh extraction, on INRs for 3D geometries by using arithmetic rules to bound the output range of the network within a spatial region. However, the analysis bounds are often too conservative for complex scientific data. In this paper, we present an improved technique for range analysis by revisiting the arithmetic rules and analyzing the probability distribution of the network output within a spatial region. We model this distribution efficiently as a Gaussian distribution by applying the central limit theorem. Excluding low probability values, we are able to tighten the output bounds, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the value range, and hence more accurate identification of iso-surface cells and more efficient iso-surface extraction on INRs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of the iso-surface extraction time on four datasets compared to the original range analysis method and can also be generalized to other geometric query tasks.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Haoyu Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Han-Wei Shen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Haoyu Li"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3365089","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":["Iso-surface extraction, implicit neural representation, uncertainty propagation, affine arithmetic."],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"tvcg0","slot_id":"v-tvcg-20243365089","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Improving Efficiency of Iso-Surface Extraction on Implicit Neural Representations Using Uncertainty Propagation","uid":"v-tvcg-20243365089","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-tvcg-20243368060":{"abstract":"Visual analytics supports data analysis tasks within complex domain problems.

Large language models have demonstrated the ability to interpret various forms of textual data, offering the potential to facilitate intelligent support for visual analytics. We propose LEVA, a framework that uses large language models to enhance users' VA workflows at multiple stages: onboarding, exploration, and summarization. To support onboarding, we use large language models to interpret visualization designs and view relationships based on system specifications. For exploration, we use large language models to recommend insights based on the analysis of system status and data to facilitate mixed-initiative exploration.

One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users' natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yuan Tian"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Weiwei Cui"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Dazhen Deng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Xinjing Yi"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yurun Yang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Haidong Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yuan Tian"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3368621","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":["Natural language interfaces, large language models, data visualization"],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"tvcg0","slot_id":"v-tvcg-20243368621","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"ChartGPT: Leveraging LLMs to Generate Charts from Abstract Natural Language","uid":"v-tvcg-20243368621","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-tvcg-20243372104":{"abstract":"With the rise of short-form video platforms and the increasing availability of data, we see the potential for people to share short-form videos embedded with data in situ (e.g., daily steps when running) to increase the credibility and expressiveness of their stories.

We propose an algorithm that compensates for irregular sample distributions by a smooth transformation of the scatterplot's visual domain. Our algorithm evaluates the scatterplot's density distribution to compute a regularization mapping based on integral images of the rasterized density function. The mapping preserves the samples' neighborhood relations. Few regularization iterations suffice to achieve a nearly uniform sample distribution that efficiently uses the available screen space.

Together with experts in nondestructive evaluation, we designed a novel interactive multimodal visualization approach to create a combined view of the co-registered X-ray and neutron acquisitions of industrial objects. Using an automatic topological segmentation of the bivariate histogram of X-ray and neutron values as a starting point, the system provides a simple yet effective interface to easily create, explore, and adjust a multimodal isualization.

In contrast, we describe in this paper a versatile approach (supporting both triangulated domains and regular grids) for the support of topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct numbers of processes. While developing this extension, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. We describe an MPI extension of TTK\u2019s data structure for triangulation representation and traversal, a central component to the global performance and generality of TTK\u2019s topological implementations. We also introduce an intermediate interface between TTK and MPI, both at the global pipeline level, and at the fine-grain algorithmic level. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from 20% to 80% (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1536 cores). Finally, we provide a roadmap for the completion of TTK\u2019s MPI extension, along with generic recommendations for each algorithm communication category.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"E.

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model\u2019s decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens, a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model\u2019s features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study. These collective efforts underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of MARLens in enhancing our understanding of MARL-based TSC systems and pave the way for more informed and efficient traffic management strategies.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yutian Zhang"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Guohong Zheng"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Zhiyuan Liu"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Quan Li"},{"affiliations":"","email":"","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Haipeng Zeng"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Haipeng Zeng"],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3392587","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":["Traffic signal control, multi-agent, reinforcement learning, visual analytics"],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"full","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"tvcg0","slot_id":"v-tvcg-20243392587","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"MARLens: Understanding Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control via Visual Analytics","uid":"v-tvcg-20243392587","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-tvcg-20243394745":{"abstract":"The fund investment industry heavily relies on the expertise of fund managers, who bear the responsibility of managing portfolios on behalf of clients. With their investment knowledge and professional skills, fund managers gain a competitive advantage over the average investor in the market. Consequently, investors prefer entrusting their investments to fund managers rather than directly investing in funds. For these investors, the primary concern is selecting a suitable fund manager. While previous studies have employed quantitative or qualitative methods to analyze various aspects of fund managers, such as performance metrics, personal characteristics, and performance persistence, they often face challenges when dealing with a large candidate space. Moreover, distinguishing whether a fund manager's performance stems from skill or luck poses a challenge, making it difficult to align with investors' preferences in the selection process. To address these challenges, this study characterizes the requirements of investors in selecting suitable fund managers and proposes an interactive visual analytics system called FMLens. This system streamlines the fund manager selection process, allowing investors to efficiently assess and deconstruct fund managers' investment styles and abilities across multiple dimensions. Additionally, the system empowers investors to scrutinize and compare fund managers' performances. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through two case studies and a qualitative user study.

To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects. We first conduct a formative study and summarize analysis criteria, including substitution mechanisms, impact attributes, and design requirements from stakeholders. Next, we propose the Minimal Substitution Model to simulate substitutive systems of NFT projects that can be feasibly represented as node-link graphs.

Accordingly, we develop a multi-view visual analytics system, namely NFTracer, allowing interactive analysis of impact dynamics in NFT transactions. We demonstrate the informativeness, effectiveness, and usability of NFTracer by performing two case studies with domain experts and one user study with stakeholders. The studies suggest that NFT projects featuring a higher degree of similarity are more likely to substitute each other.

Our method is tailored for scenes, which are procedurally constructed, based on a given set of building rules. Rendering of large scenes normally requires the entire scene available in-core, or alternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory hierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory management, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly. The key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction strategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is available in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is populated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire scene. Most of the grid cells are not filled with geometry, only those are populated that are potentially seen by the camera. The atomistic detail is populated in a compute shader and its representation is connected with acceleration data structures for hardware ray-tracing of modern GPUs. Objects which are far away, where atomistic detail is not perceivable from a given viewpoint, are represented by a triangle mesh mapped with a seamless texture, generated from the rendering of geometry from atomistic detail. The algorithm consists of two pipelines, the construction-compute pipeline, and the rendering pipeline, which work together to render molecular scenes at an atomistic resolution far beyond the limit of the GPU memory containing trillions of atoms.

While existing models like the Information Visualization Reference Model describe the data-to-visual mapping process, they often overlook a crucial intermediary step: design-specific transformations. This process, occurring after data transformation but before visual-data mapping, further derives data, such as groupings, layout, and statistics, that are essential to properly render the visualization. In this paper, we advocate for a deeper exploration of design-specific transformations, highlighting their importance in understanding visualization properties, particularly in relation to user tasks. We incorporate design-specific transformations into the Information Visualization Reference Model and propose a new formalism that encompasses the user task as a function over data. The resulting formalism offers three key benefits over existing visualization models: (1) describing tasks as compositions of functions, (2) enabling analysis of data transformations for visual-data mapping, and (3) empowering reasoning about visualization correctness and effectiveness. We further discuss the potential implications of this model on visualization theory and visualization experiment design.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Columbia University, New York City, United States"],"email":"ewu@cs.columbia.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"eugene Wu"},{"affiliations":["Tufts University, Medford, United States"],"email":"remco@cs.tufts.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Remco Chang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["eugene Wu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","slot_id":"w-beliv-1007","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Design-Specific Transforms In Visualization","uid":"w-beliv-1007","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"w-beliv-1008":{"abstract":"Stress is among the most commonly employed quality metrics and optimization criteria for dimension reduction projections of high-dimensional data.

Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure the projection\u2019s accuracy or faithfulness to the full data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and other distance-based quality metrics analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make normalized stress scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a small benchmark.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"ksmelser@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kiran Smelser"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"jacobmiller1@arizona.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Jacob Miller"},{"affiliations":["University of Arizona, Tucson, United States"],"email":"stephen.kobourov@tum.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Stephen Kobourov"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Jacob Miller"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","slot_id":"w-beliv-1008","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Normalized Stress is Not Normalized: How to Interpret Stress Correctly","uid":"w-beliv-1008","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"w-beliv-1009":{"abstract":"The cognitive processes involved in understanding and misunderstanding visualizations have not yet been fully clarified, even for well-studied designs, such as bar charts.

Therefore, policymakers are interested in the interplay between individual-level experiences and macro-political processes that play into shaping these experiences. In this context, visualisation is regarded as a medium for advocacy, creating a power balance between individuals and the power structures that influence their health and well-being. In this paper, we offer a politically-framed reflection on how visualisation creators define lived experience data, and what design choices they make for visualising them. We identify data characteristics and design choices that enable visualisation authors and consumers to engage in a process of narrative co-construction, while navigating structural forms of inequality.

We conducted a preliminary pilot study with ten individuals with varied expertise from ranging  NLP, ML, and ethics, to specific domains.

Through semi-structured interviews grounded in a set of concrete examples, we examined how CFEs influence participants' perceptions of the model's correctness, fairness, and trustworthiness, and how visualization of CFEs specifically influences those perceptions. We also surface how participants wrestle with their internal definitions of `explainability', relative to what CFEs present, their cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to the, much more widely studied phenomena, of comparing their baseline expectations of the model's performance. Compared to prior research, our findings highlight the sociotechnical frictions that CFEs surface but do not necessarily remedy.

We ultimately call on the visualization community to build a more nuanced view of complexity, to look for places to usefully integrate complexity in multiple stages of the design process, and, even when the goal is to reduce complexity, to look for the non-visual forms of complexity that may have otherwise been overlooked.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["University for Continuing Education Krems, Krems, Austria"],"email":"florian.windhager@donau-uni.ac.at","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Florian Windhager"},{"affiliations":["King's College London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"alfie.abdulrahman@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman"},{"affiliations":["University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"email":"mark-jan.bludau@fh-potsdam.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Mark-Jan Bludau"},{"affiliations":["Warwick Institute for the Science of Cities, Coventry, United Kingdom"],"email":"nicole.hengesbach@posteo.de","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nicole Hengesbach"},{"affiliations":["University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"email":"h.lamqaddam@uva.nl","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Houda Lamqaddam"},{"affiliations":["OCAD University, Toronto, Canada"],"email":"meirelles.isabel@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Isabel Meirelles"},{"affiliations":["TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"email":"b.speckmann@tue.nl","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Bettina Speckmann"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Portland, United States"],"email":"m.correll@northeastern.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Correll"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Florian Windhager"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"w-beliv0","slot_id":"w-beliv-1035","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Complexity as Design Material","uid":"w-beliv-1035","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"w-beliv-1037":{"abstract":"Qualitative data analysis is widely adopted for user evaluation, not only in the Visualisation community but also related communities, such as Human-Computer Interaction and Augmented and Virtual Reality.

Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey's results, we identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets. We also distilled five opportunities for developing a successful data science and visualization course. These opportunities include clarifying the course structure, emphasizing visualization literacy early in the course, updating the course content according to student needs, using large real-world datasets, learning from industry professionals, and promoting collaboration among students.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"shrihariniramesh@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Shri Harini Ramesh"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada","Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"fateme.rajabiyazdi@carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fateme Rajabiyazdi"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Shri Harini Ramesh"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"w-eduvis0","slot_id":"w-eduvis-1008","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science","uid":"w-eduvis-1008","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"w-eduvis-1010":{"abstract":"This report examines the implementation of the Solution Framework in a social impact project facilitated by VizForSocialGood.

While visualization has become integral to various areas, including education, our own ongoing collaboration has induced reflections and discussions we believe could benefit visualization research. In particular, we identify five key perspectives: surpassing traditional evaluation metrics by incorporating established educational measures; defining constructs based on existing learning and educational research frameworks; applying established cognitive theories to understand interpretation and interaction with visualizations; establishing uniform terminology across disciplines; and, fostering interdisciplinary convergence. We argue that by integrating educational research constructs, methodologies, and theories, visualization research can further pursue ecological validity and thereby improve the design and evaluation of visual tools. Our essay emphasizes the potential of intensified and systematic collaborations between educational scientists and visualization researchers to advance both fields, and in doing so craft visualization systems that support comprehension, retention, transfer, and critical thinking.

In cases where a single power line goes offline, due to a natural event or scheduled outage, there typically will be a contingency plan that the TSO may utilize to mitigate the situation. In cases where two or more power lines go offline, this contingency plan is no longer valid, and they must re-prepare and reason about the network in real time. A key network property that must be balanced is loadability--the range of permissible voltage levels for a specific bus (or node), understood as a function of power and its active (P) and reactive (Q) components. Loadability provides information of how much more demand a specific node can handle, before system became unstable. To increase loadability, the TSO can potentially make control actions that raise or lower P or Q, which results in change the voltage levels required to be within permissible limits. While many methods exist to calculate loadability and represent loadability to end users, there has been little focus on tailoring loadability visualizations to the unique needs of TSOs. In this paper we involve operations domain experts in a human centered design process to prototype two new loadability visualizations for TSOs. We contribute a design paper that yields: (1) a working model of the operator's decision making process, (2) example artifacts of the two data visualization techniques, and (3) a critical qualitative expert review of our designs.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Montreal, Canada"],"email":"dmarino@cim.mcgill.ca","is_corresponding":true,"name":"David Marino"},{"affiliations":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"email":"maxwellkeleher@cmail.carleton.ca","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Maxwell Keleher"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Krakow, Poland"],"email":"krzysztof.chmielowiec@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Krzysztof Chmielowiec"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Montreal, Canada"],"email":"antony.hilliard@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Antony Hilliard"},{"affiliations":["Hitachi Energy Research, Krakow, Poland"],"email":"pawel.dawidowski@hitachienergy.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Pawel Dawidowski"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["David Marino"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"w-energyvis0","slot_id":"w-energyvis-3496","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Operator-Centered Design of a Nodal Loadability Network Visualization","uid":"w-energyvis-3496","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"w-energyvis-4332":{"abstract":"The rapid growth of the solar energy industry requires advanced educational tools to train the next generation of engineers and technicians.

Human guidance in sensemaking tasks can prioritize and cluster relevant information for LLMs. However, users must translate their cognitive thinking into natural language to communicate with LLMs. Can we use more readable and operable visual representations to guide the summarization process for sensemaking? Therefore, we propose introducing an intermediate step--a schematic visual workspace for human sensemaking--before the LLM generation to steer and refine the summarization process. We conduct a series of proof-of-concept experiments to investigate the potential for enhancing the summarization by GPT-4 through visual workspaces. Leveraging a textual sensemaking dataset with a ground truth summary, we evaluate the impact of a human-generated visual workspace on LLM-generated summarization of the dataset and assess the effectiveness of space-steered summarization. We categorize several types of extractable information from typical human workspaces that can be injected into engineered prompts to steer the LLM summarization. The results demonstrate how such workspaces can help align an LLM with the ground truth, leading to more accurate summarization results than without the workspaces.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Computer Science Department, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"tangxxwhu@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Xuxin Tang"},{"affiliations":["Dod, Laurel, United States"],"email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliations":["Department of Defense, College Park, United States"],"email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliations":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"canliu@cityu.edu.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Can Liu"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"naren@cs.vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Naren Ramakrishnan"},{"affiliations":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States"],"email":"north@vt.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Chris North"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Xuxin Tang"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access":false,"paper_award":"","paper_type":"workshop","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"w-nlviz0","slot_id":"w-nlviz-1004","time_end":"","time_stamp":"","time_start":"","title":"Steering LLM Summarization with Visual Workspaces for Sensemaking","uid":"w-nlviz-1004","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"w-nlviz-1007":{"abstract":"We explore the use of segmentation and summarization methods for the generation of real-time conversation topic timelines, in the context of glanceable Augmented Reality (AR) visualization.

It allows the model to explore multiple solution paths and select the best course of action, producing a tree-like structure of intermediate steps (i.e., thoughts). This method was shown to be effective for several problem types. However, the official implementation has a high barrier to usage as it requires setup overhead and incorporates task-specific problem templates which are difficult to generalize to new problem types.

However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence.

In a discrete setting, the Morse-Smale complex is commonly extracted by constructing a combinatorial gradient assuming the steepest descent direction. Previous works have shown that this method results in a geometric embedding of the separatrices that can be fundamentally different from those in the continuous case. To achieve a similar embedding, different approaches for constructing a combinatorial gradient were proposed. In this paper, we show that these approaches generate a different topology, i.e., the connectivity between critical points changes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the steepest descent method can compute topologically and geometrically accurate Morse-Smale complexes when applied to certain types of grids.

First, state-of-the-art probabilistic uncertainty visual- ization framework is limited to bivariate data (two variables). Sec- ond, the existing uncertainty visualization algorithms use compu- tationally intensive techniques and lack support for cross-platform portability. Third, as a consequence of the computational expense, integration into interactive production visualization tools is imprac- tical. In this work, we address all three issues and make a threefold contribution. First, we generalize the state-of-the-art probabilis- tic framework for bivariate data to multivariate data with a arbi- trary number of variables.

Marching cubes (MC) algorithms with linear interpolation are commonly used for isosurface extraction and visualization.  Although linear interpolation is easy to implement, it has limitations when the underlying data is complex and high-order, which is the case for most real-world data. Linear interpolation can output vertices at the wrong location. Its inability to deal with sharp features and features smaller than grid cells can create holes and broken pieces in the extracted isosurface. Despite these limitations, isosurface visualizations typically do not include insight into the spatial location and the magnitude of these errors. We utilize high-order interpolation methods with MC algorithms and interactive visualization to highlight these uncertainties. Our visualization tool helps identify the regions of high interpolation errors. It also allows users to query local areas for details and compare the differences between isosurfaces from different interpolation methods. In addition, we employ high-order methods to identify and reconstruct possible features that linear methods cannot detect.  We showcase how our visualization tool helps explore and understand the extracted isosurface errors through synthetic and real-world data.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salk Lake City, United States"],"email":"touermi@sci.utah.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Timbwaoga A.

Our approach achieves at least a 99\\% level of rank preservation, with order flipping occurring only at pairs with extremely similar depth values that pose no statistical differences.

In this study, we showed participants forecasts of wind speed data and they made decisions based on their predictions about the future wind speed. We allowed participants to choose how many forecasts to view prior to making a decision, and we manipulated the ordering of the forecasts and the cost of each additional forecast. We found that participants viewed more forecasts when the outcome was more ambiguous. The order of the forecasts had little impact on their decisions when there was no cost for the additional information. However, when there was a cost for each forecast, the participants were much more likely to make a guess based on only the first forecast shown.
