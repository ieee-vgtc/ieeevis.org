[{"abstract":"Trame is an open-source, Python-based, scalable integration framework for visual analytics. It is the culmination of decades of work\u2014by a large and active community\u2014beginning with the creation of VTK, the growth of ParaView as a premier high-performance, client\u2013server computing system, and more recently the creation of web tools, such as VTK.js and VTK.wasm. As an integration environment, trame relies on open-source standards and tools that can be easily combined into effective computing solutions. We have long recognized that impactful analytics tools must be ubiquitous\u2014meaning they run on all major computing platforms\u2014and integrate/interoperate easily with external packages, such as data systems and processing tools, application UI frameworks, and 2-D/3-D graphical libraries. In this article, we present the architecture and use of trame for applications ranging from simple dashboards to complex workflow-based applications. We also describe examples that readily incorporate external tools and run without coding changes on desktop, mobile, cloud, client\u2013server, and interactive computing notebooks, such as Jupyter.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"S\u00e9bastien Jourdain"},{"email":null,"name":"Patrick O\u2019Leary"},{"email":null,"name":"Will Schroeder"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"S\u00e9bastien Jourdain"},{"email":null,"name":"Patrick O\u2019Leary"},{"email":null,"name":"Will Schroeder"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"sebastien.jourdain@kitware.com","name":"S\u00e9bastien Jourdain"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"sebastien.jourdain@kitware.com","name":"S\u00e9bastien Jourdain"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:19:02.983232+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2025.3540264","event_prefix":"v-cga","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"013c31af-6df4-4dea-b01c-3f4cd7af88df","keywords":["Scientific computing","Visual analytics","Computer architecture","Licenses","Libraries","Servers","Security","Software tools","Standards","Open source software"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"Developed an open, Python-based framework for visual analytics.

The results show no evidence that visualization and interaction mechanisms influence vote choice. The metaphoric map led to lower perceived and factual political knowledge and was harder to interpret, likely due to its higher visualization literacy demands. Notably, participants using metaphoric map offered more objective, non-ideological interpretations of their political position, suggesting potential to foster unbiased political comprehension.

Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts. Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"hetingying.hty@gmail.com","name":"Tingying He"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"maggie.mccracken@psych.utah.edu","name":"Maggie McCracken"},{"affiliation":"University College London","email":"d.hajas@ucl.ac.uk","name":"Daniel Hajas"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"sarah.creem@psych.utah.edu","name":"Sarah Creem-Regehr"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"alexander.lex@gmail.com","name":"Alexander Lex"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"hetingying.hty@gmail.com","name":"Tingying He"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"maggie.mccracken@psych.utah.edu","name":"Maggie McCracken"},{"affiliation":"University College London","email":"d.hajas@ucl.ac.uk","name":"Daniel Hajas"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"sarah.creem@psych.utah.edu","name":"Sarah Creem-Regehr"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"alexander.lex@gmail.com","name":"Alexander Lex"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hetingying.hty@gmail.com","name":"Tingying He"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"hetingying.hty@gmail.com","name":"Tingying He"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945552455041045","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"055a075f-b15e-43ec-becb-cc09ad944d2c","keywords":["Accessibility","tactile representations"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/9dwgq/","open_access_supplemental_question":"We provide an extensive, well-documented 40-page appendix that includes materials and detailed descriptions of the full design and user study processes.","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1514-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUxNC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzR9.aSvthK_PPPti0AIDaUneLQ5TiPEpBAAehhWpc4LMq2U","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1514-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=10ec622d1df0d0f12f5bfb886cc8a5d28badae26225951d78b248fcbbf100f83","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1514-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=6aa2949cb316a67ed4ad346ce642c0fef3108ffb6d2bae1b7218ec62b1352cf0","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners\n- Accessibility experts\n- Educators of blind and low-vision individuals\n- Inclusive design practitioners\n\nApplications:\n- Use our tactile chart designs to teach complex visualizations to BLV learners\n- Support development of instructional materials for BLV individuals\n- Inform inclusive design of data tools and alt text strategies","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21462","program_paper_id":"1514","title":"Using Tactile Charts to Support Comprehension and Learning of Complex Visualizations for Blind and Low-Vision Individuals","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Analytic provenance can be visually encoded to help users track their ongoing analysis trajectories, recall past interactions, and inform new analytic directions. Despite its significance, provenance is often hardwired into analytics systems, affording limited user control and opportunities for self-reflection. We thus propose modeling provenance as an attribute that is available to users during analysis. We demonstrate this concept by modeling two provenance attributes that track the recency and frequency of user interactions with data. We integrate these attributes into a visual data analysis system prototype, ProvenanceLens, wherein users can visualize their interaction recency and frequency by mapping them to encoding channels (e.g., color, size) or applying data transformations (e.g., filter, sort). Using ProvenanceLens as a design probe, we conduct an exploratory study with sixteen users to investigate how these provenance-tracking affordances are utilized for both decision-making and self-reflection. We find that users can accurately and confidently answer questions about their analysis, and we show that mismatches between the user's mental model and the provenance encodings can be surprising, thereby prompting useful self-reflection. We also report on the user strategies surrounding these affordances, and reflect on their intuitiveness and effectiveness in representing provenance.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Arpit Narechania"},{"email":null,"name":"Shunan Guo"},{"email":null,"name":"Eunyee Koh"},{"email":null,"name":"Alex Endert"},{"email":null,"name":"Jane Hoffswell"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Arpit Narechania"},{"email":null,"name":"Shunan Guo"},{"email":null,"name":"Eunyee Koh"},{"email":null,"name":"Alex Endert"},{"email":null,"name":"Jane Hoffswell"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"arpitnarechania@gmail.com","name":"Arpit Narechania"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"arpitnarechania@gmail.com","name":"Arpit Narechania"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.84764+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3571708","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"063cc125-d8ef-4935-baa1-e74f6262ea81","keywords":["Data visualization","Visualization","Analytical models","Encoding","Data models","Data analysis","Image color analysis","History","Time-frequency analysis","Probes"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Tool builders can learn how to offer customisable provenance tracking capabilities to steer user behaviour in analytics systems in any domain.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11784","program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2024-08-0792.R2]","title":"Utilizing Provenance as an Attribute for Visual Data Analysis: A Design Probe with ProvenanceLens","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Layered network visualizations assign each node to one of several parallel axes. They can convey sequence or flow data, hierarchies, or multiple data classes, but edge crossings and long edges often impair readability. Layout algorithms can reduce edge crossings and shorten edges using quick heuristics or optimal methods that prioritize human readability over computation speed. This work uses an optimization metaheuristic to provide the best of both worlds: high-quality layouts within a predetermined execution time. Our adaptation of the large neighborhood search (LNS) metaheuristic repeatedly selects fixed-sized subgraphs to lay out optimally. We conducted a computational evaluation using 450 synthetic networks to compare five ways of selecting candidate nodes, four ways of selecting their neighboring subgraph, and three criteria for determining subgraph size. LNS generally halved the number of crossings versus the barycentric heuristic while maintaining a reasonable runtime. Our best approach randomly selected candidate nodes, used degree centrality to pick cluster-like neighborhoods, and chose smaller neighborhoods that could be optimally laid out in 0.6 or 1.2 seconds (versus 6 seconds). In a case study visualizing 13 control flow graphs, most with over 1000 nodes, we show that our method can be employed to create visualizations with fewer crossings than Tabu Search, another metaheuristic, and vastly outperforms an ILP solver when runtime is bounded.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Connor Wilson"},{"email":null,"name":"Tarik Crnovrsanin"},{"email":null,"name":"Eduardo Puerta"},{"email":null,"name":"Cody Dunne"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Connor Wilson"},{"email":null,"name":"Tarik Crnovrsanin"},{"email":null,"name":"Eduardo Puerta"},{"email":null,"name":"Cody Dunne"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wilson.conn@northeastern.edu","name":"Connor Wilson"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"wilson.conn@northeastern.edu","name":"Connor Wilson"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.906116+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3537898","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"06d5d55a-bd4b-4c6f-9f01-60b54e657562","keywords":["Layout","Metaheuristics","Visualization","Runtime","Optimization models","Search problems","Reverse engineering","Minimization","Heuristic algorithms","Graph drawing"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Practitioners whose work involves generating layouts of network graphs, particularly for smaller network graphs when layout quality is a high priority.

Whereas past sensemaking models have been grounded in positivist assumptions about the nature of knowledge, we reframe data sensemaking in critical, humanistic terms by approaching it through an interpretivist lens. Our three-phase process model uses the analogy of an iceberg, where data is the visible tip of underlying schemas. In the Add phase, the analyst acquires data, incorporates explicit schemas from the data, and absorbs the tacit schemas of both data and people. In the Check phase, the analyst interprets the data with respect to the current schemas and evaluates whether the schemas match the data. In the Refine phase, the analyst considers the role of power, articulates what was tacit into explicitly stated schemas, updates data, and formulates findings. Our model has four important distinguishing features: Tacit and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact, and Schematic Multiplicity. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas in different academic traditions. We validate the descriptive and prescriptive power of our model through four analysis scenarios: noticing uncollected data, learning to wrangle data, downplaying inconvenient data, and measuring with sensors. We conclude by discussing the value of interpretivism, the virtue of epistemic humility, and the pluralism this sensemaking model can foster.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Charles Berret"},{"email":null,"name":"Tamara Munzner"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Charles Berret"},{"email":null,"name":"Tamara Munzner"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"charles.berret@gmail.com","name":"Charles Berret"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"charles.berret@gmail.com","name":"Charles Berret"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.274048+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3486613","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"0833c9dd-52a3-4a64-bbcd-15c9d10ac8aa","keywords":["Analytical models","Data models","Data analysis","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Icebergs","Shape","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Visual analytics","Tuning"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"-","pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data Journalists, Data Scientists, Philosophers","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04758","program_paper_id":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3486613","title":"Iceberg Sensemaking: A Process Model for Critical Data Analysis and Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"User interfaces for inspecting spatio-temporal events often allow their users to filter the events by specifying a time window with a time slider. We consider the case that filtered events are visualized on a map using textual or iconic labels. However, to ensure a clear visualization, not all filtered events are annotated with a label. We present algorithms for setting up a data structure that encodes for every possible time window the set of displayed labels. Our algorithms ensure that the displayed labels never overlap and guarantee the stability of the labeling during certain basic interactions with the time slider. Assuming that the labels have different priorities (weights), we aim to maximize the weight of the displayed labels integrated over all possible time windows. As basic interactions, we consider moving the entire time window, symmetrically scaling it, and dragging one of its endpoints. We consider two stability requirements: (1) during a basic interaction, a label should appear and disappear at most once; (2) if a label is displayed for a time window Q, then it is also displayed for all the time windows contained in Q and that contain its timestamp. We prove that finding an optimal solution is NP-hard and propose efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for unit-square and unit-disk labels, as well as a fast greedy heuristic for arbitrarily shaped labels. In experiments on real-world data, we compare the non-exact algorithms with an exact approach through integer linear programming.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Annika Bonerath"},{"email":null,"name":"Anne Driemel"},{"email":null,"name":"Jan-Henrik Haunert"},{"email":null,"name":"Herman Haverkort"},{"email":null,"name":"Elmar Langetepe"},{"email":null,"name":"Benjamin Niedermann"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Annika Bonerath"},{"email":null,"name":"Anne Driemel"},{"email":null,"name":"Jan-Henrik Haunert"},{"email":null,"name":"Herman Haverkort"},{"email":null,"name":"Elmar Langetepe"},{"email":null,"name":"Benjamin Niedermann"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"bonerath@igg.uni-bonn.de","name":"Annika Bonerath"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"bonerath@igg.uni-bonn.de","name":"Annika Bonerath"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.370804+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3527582","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"085f602b-ba6f-4a24-ab38-7a60af7ad270","keywords":["Labeling","Data visualization","Annotations","Tornadoes","Heuristic algorithms","Data structures","Spatial databases","Reproducibility of results","Earthquakes","Approximation algorithms"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":null,"preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"[10.1109/TVCG 2025.3527582 ]","title":"Algorithms for Consistent Dynamic Labeling of Maps With a Time-Slider Interface","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Color is a powerful tool in data visualization, but for individuals with color vision deficiencies (CVD), hue can become a barrier rather than an aid. In this paper, we examine how real-world visualizations are perceived across vision profiles through three complementary studies. Study 1 assessed how normal vision participants rated 46 visualizations shown in original and simulated red/green colorblind versions. Study 2 collected matched responses from participants with diagnosed CVD. Study 3 involved in-depth interviews exploring how users interpret, adapt to, and evaluate inaccessible designs. Across studies, we find that simulations capture directional perceptual shifts but fail to reflect the interpretive breakdowns and emotional work described by real CVD users. Factor analysis reveals two dominant perceptual dimensions: functional utility and affective experience. While normal vision participants prioritize functional clarity, CVD users rely more on structural cues and emotional resonance, particularly when color is unreliable. Qualitative insights show that perceptual breakdowns occur not only in high-interference charts but also when redundant encoding or layout scaffolding is missing. We synthesize these findings and offer empirically grounded design recommendations to guide inclusive visualization practices. Our results argue that accessibility must go beyond color correction, embracing structural clarity, redundancy, and real-user validation to ensure inclusive visual communication.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","email":"zjian115@asu.edu","name":"Zhuojun Jiang"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"aarunku5@asu.edu","name":"Anjana Arunkumar"},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","email":"cbryan16@asu.edu","name":"Chris Bryan"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","email":"zjian115@asu.edu","name":"Zhuojun Jiang"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"aarunku5@asu.edu","name":"Anjana Arunkumar"},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","email":"cbryan16@asu.edu","name":"Chris Bryan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zjian115@asu.edu","name":"Zhuojun Jiang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"zjian115@asu.edu","name":"Zhuojun Jiang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"093872c4-bec7-4c27-bb8e-c89465a4381b","keywords":["Information Visualization","Perception & Cognition","Colorblindness","Accessibility"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/ymucn/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1755-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc1NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.V9hZJVb13hsji2Sm1aDmON8BR7dQmjmBsi0j7O4uoD0","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1755-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=811e185ea6b0921e4fb987a0ef386be3de7604b17c3a734b6ff3b865384a0514","practitioners_statement":"This paper would be of interest to data visualization designers, UX researchers, and data scientists.

However, in addition to the hierarchical structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities, frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood preservation.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"patrick.paetzold@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Patrick Paetzold"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"rebecca.kehlbeck@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Rebecca Kehlbeck"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"yumeng.xue@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Yumeng Xue"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"bin.chen@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Bin Chen"},{"affiliation":"Renmin University of China","email":"cloudseawang@gmail.com","name":"Yunhai Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"oliver.deussen@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Oliver Deussen"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"patrick.paetzold@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Patrick Paetzold"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"rebecca.kehlbeck@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Rebecca Kehlbeck"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"yumeng.xue@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Yumeng Xue"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"bin.chen@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Bin Chen"},{"affiliation":"Renmin University of China","email":"cloudseawang@gmail.com","name":"Yunhai Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"oliver.deussen@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Oliver Deussen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"patrick.paetzold@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Patrick Paetzold"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"patrick.paetzold@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Patrick Paetzold"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"093d9538-804e-4951-a5bf-dab72e99c35d","keywords":["Hierarchical data","Treemap","Voronoi diagram","Voronoi treemap"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/cgmi/Neighborhood-Preserving-Voronoi-Treemaps","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1598-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU5OC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.40Qunv_t5UC7bUSDSAl4REi4LbQq0j5kix8rfPEJ88o","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1598-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=eed5662d148404cf005e5fb478434ed50b92ac83bccd47195cbf669de804f8fc","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1598-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=e38a936ab21252cc7fc3819323671993dee16bf3e38bf4c8d8e22d6fc712b719","practitioners_statement":"Treemaps are a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data.\nAmong them, Voronoi treemaps are particularly appreciated for their organic appearance.

To enhance the performance of the model, the developers must optimize it to decrease inference latency. Auto-scheduling, an automated approach that generates optimization schemes, offers a feasible option for large-scale auto-deployment. Nevertheless, the low-level code generated by auto-scheduling closely resembles hardware coding and may present challenges for human comprehension, thereby hindering future manual optimization efforts. In this study, we introduce ASight, a visual analytics system to assist engineers in identifying performance bottlenecks, comprehending the auto-generated low-level code, and obtaining insights from auto-scheduling optimizations. We develop a subgraph matching algorithm capable of identifying graph isomorphism among Intermediate Representations to track performance bottlenecks from low-level metrics to high-level computational graphs. To address the substantial profiling metrics involved in auto-scheduling and derive optimization design principles by summarizing commonalities among auto-scheduling optimizations, we propose an enhanced visualization for the large search space of auto-scheduling. We validate the effectiveness of ASight through two case studies, one focused on a local machine and the other on a data center, along with a quantitative experiment exploring optimization design principles.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Laixin Xie"},{"email":null,"name":"Chenyang Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Ruofei Ma"},{"email":null,"name":"Xingxing Xing"},{"email":null,"name":"Wei Wan"},{"email":null,"name":"Quan Li"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Laixin Xie"},{"email":null,"name":"Chenyang Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Ruofei Ma"},{"email":null,"name":"Xingxing Xing"},{"email":null,"name":"Wei Wan"},{"email":null,"name":"Quan Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"liquan@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Quan Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"liquan@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Quan Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.370804+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3574194","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"0db7ecd3-a51e-4c72-bc36-d06d31c08c7f","keywords":["Optimization","Codes","Hardware","Schedules","Runtime","Measurement","Visual analytics","Optimal scheduling","Aerodynamics","Training"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data Scientists, Machine Learning Practitioners, Game Development Team","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2024-07-0651.R2]","title":"ASight: Fine-tuning Auto-Scheduling Optimizations for Model Deployment via Visual Analytics","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a relatively new \nmachine learning technology for accelerating 3D graphics, by \nrendering at lower resolutions, and inferring what the higher \nresolution output should look like.

Unfortunately, when individuals do not fully understand the incremental steps needed to change their circumstances, they risk following misguided paths that can lead to significant, long-term adverse consequences. Existing recourse approaches focus exclusively on the final recourse goal but neglect the possible incremental steps to reach the goal with real-life constraints, user preferences, and model artifacts. To address this gap, we formulate a visual analytic workflow for incremental recourse planning in collaboration with AI/ML experts and contribute an interactive visualization interface that helps data subjects efficiently navigate the recourse alternatives and make an informed decision. We present a usage scenario and subjective feedback from observational studies with twelve graduate students using a real-world dataset, which demonstrates that our approach can be instrumental for data subjects in choosing a suitable recourse path.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","email":"kaustavbhatt94@gmail.com","name":"Kaustav Bhattacharjee"},{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","email":"jy448@njit.edu","name":"Jun Yuan"},{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","email":"dasgupta.aritra@gmail.com","name":"Aritra Dasgupta"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","email":"kaustavbhatt94@gmail.com","name":"Kaustav Bhattacharjee"},{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","email":"jy448@njit.edu","name":"Jun Yuan"},{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","email":"dasgupta.aritra@gmail.com","name":"Aritra Dasgupta"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kaustavbhatt94@gmail.com","name":"Kaustav Bhattacharjee"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"kaustavbhatt94@gmail.com","name":"Kaustav Bhattacharjee"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.605934+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945529340362783","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"0ecc86cf-63c0-4483-9849-b207a438bb59","keywords":["Visual analytics","recourse","machine learning"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/ngzcm/","open_access_supplemental_question":"This is a novel method for designing visual analytic interfaces for algorithmic recourse.

The current form of training and coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen, 5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this approach to other precision-based sports.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Mid Sweden University","email":"emin.zerman@miun.se","name":"Emin Zerman"},{"affiliation":"Mid Sweden University","email":"j_c_kc@live.se","name":"Jonas Carlsson"},{"affiliation":"Mid Sweden University","email":"marten.sjostrom@miun.se","name":"M\u00e5rten Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Mid Sweden University","email":"emin.zerman@miun.se","name":"Emin Zerman"},{"affiliation":"Mid Sweden University","email":"j_c_kc@live.se","name":"Jonas Carlsson"},{"affiliation":"Mid Sweden University","email":"marten.sjostrom@miun.se","name":"M\u00e5rten Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"emin.zerman@miun.se","name":"Dr. Emin Zerman"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"emin.zerman@miun.se","name":"Dr. Emin Zerman"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.174731+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"0f3ea5e8-4bc5-4e8a-8619-1ce981d4e8e1","keywords":["Composite visualization","sports coaching","marksmanship training","first-person video","user studies"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1143-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExNDMtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM5fQ.zl_FCX-2FIURxwZzki6jD-bIcgoB7NQf5X0RsFBK1hc","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1143-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=7e5321f70734774e18663c10bbf57ce3ed021064c8fcc23b6b0d5b62472b2815","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1143-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=71f201183ca3c393804d1533dbd8babc2648a2d81c40b5c1773a21d52f9cbcad","practitioners_statement":"This paper will be of interest to practitioners involved in sports coaching, sports technology development, human performance analysis, and training design, particularly those working in precision sports such as marksmanship, archery, and baseball.

Merge trees are topological descriptors that record the evolution of connected components in the sublevel sets of scalar fields. We present a new technique for modeling and comparing merge trees using tools from partial optimal transport. In particular, we model a merge tree as a measure network, that is, a network equipped with a probability distribution, and define a notion of distance on the space of merge trees inspired by partial optimal transport. Such a distance offers a new and flexible perspective for encoding intrinsic and extrinsic information in the comparative measures of merge trees. More importantly, it gives rise to a partial matching between topological features in time-varying data, thus enabling flexible topology tracking for scientific simulations. Furthermore, such partial matching may be interpreted as probabilistic coupling between features at adjacent time steps, which gives rise to probabilistic tracking graphs. We derive a stability result for our distance and provide numerous experiments indicating the efficacy of our framework in extracting meaningful feature tracks.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Mingzhe Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Xinyuan Yan"},{"email":null,"name":"Lin Yan"},{"email":null,"name":"Tom Needham"},{"email":null,"name":"Bei Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Mingzhe Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Xinyuan Yan"},{"email":null,"name":"Lin Yan"},{"email":null,"name":"Tom Needham"},{"email":null,"name":"Bei Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"beiwang@sci.utah.edu","name":"Bei Wang Phillips"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"beiwang@sci.utah.edu","name":"Bei Wang Phillips"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.906116+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3561300","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"0ffcd3a5-a31e-4532-9adb-8306bbb1518f","keywords":["Probabilistic logic","Feature extraction","Vegetation","Topology","Probability distribution","Extraterrestrial measurements","Surveys","Visualization","Vectors","Reviews"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Domain scientists working with scalar fields and TDA practitioners would be interested.\nThis work provides a framework with open-source code that can be applied to different data and applications.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02895","program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2025.3561300]","title":"Flexible and Probabilistic Topology Tracking with Partial Optimal Transport","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization design in communicating uncertainties.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"huayuan221@gmail.com","name":"Huayuan Ye"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"10215102469@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"He Zhu"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"siwei.fu@zju.edu.cn","name":"Siwei Fu"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"cbwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Changbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"chli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Chenhui Li"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"huayuan221@gmail.com","name":"Huayuan Ye"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"10215102469@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"He Zhu"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"siwei.fu@zju.edu.cn","name":"Siwei Fu"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"cbwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Changbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"chli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Chenhui Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"10233019-3fcc-4f01-b478-96b0ec01cf29","keywords":["Spatial interpolation","spatiotemporal data","uncertainty visualization","graph neural network"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/jtchen2k/relmap/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1643-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTY0My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzZ9.VbKEt3BC9JXh9Vy6Ok4WM2w7qQIRLQlLukPzYz7pkV0","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1643-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=9e8216b64c6afcc619f2f1d47cd7b1a4eb581af6ac2a0a3a977e86cd51db321b","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1643-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=546124035a28359081949eadb7a45882f27a709870209a78c89fd010fe8bb820","practitioners_statement":"Geoscientists, climate engineers/researchers, and general visualization designers.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01240","program_paper_id":"1643","title":"RelMap: Reliable Spatiotemporal Sensor Data Visualization via Imputative Spatial Interpolation","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"You Only Have Seven Seconds is a cinematic artistic visualization derived from an interactive AI art installation (ReCollection) that explores how machine intelligence can reassemble collective human memory through language input.

The GoG helped expand the expressive gamut of visualization by moving beyond fixed chart types and towards a design space of composable operators. Yet, the resultant design space has surprising limitations, inconsistencies, and cliffs---even seemingly simple charts like mosaics, waffles, and ribbons fall out of scope of most GoG implementations. To author such charts, visualization designers must either rely on overburdened grammar developers to implement purpose-built mark types (thus reintroducing the issues of typologies) or drop to lower-level frameworks. In response, we present GoFish: a declarative visualization grammar that formalizes Gestalt principles (e.g., uniform spacing, containment, and connection) that have heretofore been complected in GoG constructs. These graphical operators achieve greater expressive power than their predecessors by enabling recursive composition: they can be nested and overlapped arbitrarily. Through a diverse example gallery, we demonstrate how graphical operators free users to arrange shapes in many different ways while retaining the benefits of high-level grammars like scale resolution and coordinate transform management. Recursive composition naturally yields an infinite design space that blurs the boundary between an expressive, low-level grammar and a concise, high-level one. In doing so, we point towards an updated theory of visualization, one that is open to an innumerable space of graphic representations instead of limited to a fixed set of good designs.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"jopo@mit.edu","name":"Josh Pollock"},{"affiliation":"MIT","email":"arvindsatya@mit.edu","name":"Arvind Satyanarayan"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"jopo@mit.edu","name":"Josh Pollock"},{"affiliation":"MIT","email":"arvindsatya@mit.edu","name":"Arvind Satyanarayan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jopo@mit.edu","name":"Josh M.

Many quality metrics concerning data pattern, perception, and aesthetics are proposed, and respective optimization algorithms are developed. However, the optimization problems related to ordering are often difficult to solve (e.g., TSP is NP-complete), and developing specialized optimization algorithms is costly. In this paper, we propose Versatile Ordering Network (VON), which automatically learns the strategy to order given a quality metric. VON uses the quality metric to evaluate its solutions, and leverages reinforcement learning with a greedy rollout baseline to improve itself. This keeps the metric transparent and allows VON to optimize over different metrics. Additionally, VON uses the attention mechanism to collect information across scales and reposition the data points with respect to the current context. This allows VONs to deal with data points following different distributions. We examine the effectiveness of VON under different usage scenarios and metrics. The results demonstrate that VON can produce comparable results to specialized solvers.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Zehua Yu"},{"email":null,"name":"Weihan Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Sihan Pan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Tao"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Zehua Yu"},{"email":null,"name":"Weihan Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Sihan Pan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Tao"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yuzh58@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Zehua Yu"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yuzh58@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Zehua Yu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.84764+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3520208","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"13eab0df-a9ad-4614-bc89-4a645ab9438a","keywords":["Measurement","Visualization","Attention mechanisms","Neural networks","Layout","Data visualization","Reinforcement learning","Optimization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data scientists, ML researchers, visualization scientists.

Beyond training, examining the loss function with respect to a network\u2019s parameters (i.e., as a loss landscape) can reveal insights into the architecture and learning process. While the local structure of the loss landscape surrounding an individual solution can be characterized using a variety of approaches, the global structure of a loss landscape, which includes potentially many local minima corresponding to different solutions, remains far more difficult to conceptualize and visualize. To address this difficulty, we introduce LossLens, a visual analytics framework that explores loss landscapes at multiple scales. LossLens integrates metrics from global and local scales into a comprehensive visual representation, enhancing model diagnostics. We demonstrate LossLens through two case studies: visualizing how residual connections influence a ResNet-20, and visualizing how physical parameters influence a physics-informed neural network solving a simple convection problem.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Tiankai Xie"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiaqing Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Yaoqing Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Caleb Geniesse"},{"email":null,"name":"Ge Shi"},{"email":null,"name":"Ajinkya Jeevan Chaudhari"},{"email":null,"name":"John Kevin Cava"},{"email":null,"name":"Michael W.

We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial\nscales. Our study\u2019s results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments made in assessing spatial correlation.

However, when visualizations incorporate deceptive design elements\u2014such as truncated or inverted axes, unjustified 3D effects, or violations of best practices\u2014they can mislead viewers and distort understanding, spreading misinformation. While some deceptive tactics are obvious, others subtly manipulate perception while maintaining a fa\u00e7ade of legitimacy. As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret visualizations, especially by non-expert users, it is critical to understand how susceptible these models are to deceptive visual designs. In this study, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret misleading visualizations. By analyzing over 16,000  responses from ten different models across eight distinct types of misleading chart designs, we demonstrate that most VLMs are deceived by them. This leads to altered interpretations of charts, despite the underlying data remaining the same.

Studies of design practice often focus on individual designers\u2019 decisions and reflections, offering limited insight into the collaborative and systemic dimensions of professional work. In this paper, we propose a systems-level reframing of design judgment grounded in the coordination and adaptation that sustain progress amid uncertainty, constraint, and misalignment. Drawing on sustained engagement across multiple empirical studies\u2014including ethnographic observation of design teams and qualitative studies of individual practitioners\u2014we identify recurring episodes in which coherence was preserved not by selecting an optimal option, but by repairing alignment, adjusting plans, and reframing goals. We interpret these dynamics through the lens of Joint Cognitive Systems, which provide tools for analyzing how judgment emerges as a distributed capacity within sociotechnical activity. This perspective surfaces often-invisible work in visualization design and offers researchers a new conceptual vocabulary for studying how design activity is sustained in practice.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul Parsons"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"arranridley@gmail.com","name":"Arran Ridley"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul Parsons"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"arranridley@gmail.com","name":"Arran Ridley"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul C Parsons"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul C Parsons"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.501591+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"164ea18d-29f7-49a8-87e4-4d95da79af04","keywords":["Human-centered Computing [Visualization]"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1237-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMzctZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY2fQ.opvoFOPUO-WOoYV2CUmqTY0KVrT_zC6Aa7dX7RhfXZM","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1237-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=e2a9c24ac55e2b6f2f267204aa55f632c018d480c12c50da1e8700169028cc46","practitioners_statement":"This paper may interest practitioners involved in collaborative or client-facing visualization work, including data journalists, data visualization designers, data scientists, and project leads.

While researchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of persuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion resides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in current visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis of octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across centuries and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema theory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th century to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement their persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual metaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies are applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the above analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings. For instance, contrary to the common perception that octopus maps are primarily a historical phenomenon, our research shows that they remain a lively design convention in today\u2019s digital age. Additionally, while most octopus maps stem from Western discourse that views the octopus as an evil symbol, some designs offer alternative interpretations, highlighting the dynamic nature of rhetoric across different sociocultural settings. Lastly, drawing from the lessons provided by octopus maps, we discuss the associated ethical concerns of persuasive visualization.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","email":"daocheng@iastate.edu","name":"Daocheng Lin"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"wangyifanlea@gmail.com","name":"Yifan Wang"},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","email":"flora20@sjtu.edu.cn","name":"Yutong Yang"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"xingyulan96@gmail.com","name":"Xingyu Lan"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","email":"daocheng@iastate.edu","name":"Daocheng Lin"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"wangyifanlea@gmail.com","name":"Yifan Wang"},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","email":"flora20@sjtu.edu.cn","name":"Yutong Yang"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"xingyulan96@gmail.com","name":"Xingyu Lan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"daocheng@iastate.edu","name":"Daocheng Lin"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"daocheng@iastate.edu","name":"Daocheng Lin"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"19140b17-2652-4f77-a749-4088ec870052","keywords":["Persuasive Visualization","Map","Visual Rhetoric","Visualization Rhetoric","Metaphorical Visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1249-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTI0OS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.6U22K2ZtJSEsfeeqDuoAA3z00K3FgmXLzKs1NIKhi1c","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1249-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=334960a8e6de35d6a5a339ca97e5411429340726832cb13a4f03078bc9d072d5","practitioners_statement":"We proposed an analysis of the visual rhetoric on the octopus maps, which is a famous persuasive visualization in history, offering insights for practitioners such as data journalists, visual designers, government communicators, and educators.

Computing a layout for such graphs means embedding the node trajectories and edge surfaces over time in a 2D+t space, known as the space-time cube. Currently, these space-time cube layouts are visualized through animation or by slicing the cube at regular intervals. However, both techniques present problems such as below-average performance on tasks as well as loss of precision and difficulties in selecting timeslice intervals. In this article, we present TimeLighting, a novel visual analytics approach to visualize and explore temporal graphs embedded in the space-time cube. Our interactive approach highlights node trajectories and their movement over time, visualizes node \u201caging\u201d, and provides guidance to support users during exploration by indicating interesting time intervals (\u201cwhen\u201d) and network elements (\u201cwhere\u201d) are located for a detail-oriented investigation. This combined focus helps to gain deeper insights into the temporal network's underlying behavior. We assess the utility and efficacy of our approach through two case studies and qualitative expert evaluation. The results demonstrate how TimeLighting supports identifying temporal patterns, extracting insights from nodes with high activity, and guiding the exploration and analysis process.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Velitchko Andreev Filipov"},{"email":null,"name":"Davide Ceneda"},{"email":null,"name":"Daniel Archambault"},{"email":null,"name":"Alessio Arleo"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Velitchko Andreev Filipov"},{"email":null,"name":"Davide Ceneda"},{"email":null,"name":"Daniel Archambault"},{"email":null,"name":"Alessio Arleo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"velitchko.filipov@tuwien.ac.at","name":"Velitchko Filipov"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"velitchko.filipov@tuwien.ac.at","name":"Velitchko Filipov"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.695102+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3514858","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"19655cb7-e771-464e-8d3b-3aa6e9ca1736","keywords":["Event detection","Visual analytics","Layout","Animation","Trajectory"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Researchers in domains where temporal networks are analyzed (epidemiology, contact-tracing, social-media networks, diffusion networks)","preprint_link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10787140","program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2024-02-0154.R1]","title":"TimeLighting: Guided Exploration of 2D Temporal Network Projections","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Adjusting transparency is a common method of mitigating occlusion but is often detrimental for understanding the relative depth relationships between objects as well as removes potentially important information from the occluding object.

They leverage visualization and storytelling to convey information to broader audiences. Likewise, immersive technologies, like augmented and virtual reality devices, provide excellent potential for exploring and explaining data, thus inviting research on how data-driven storytelling transfers to immersive environments. To gain a better understanding of this exciting novel research area, we conducted a scoping review on the emerging notion of immersive data-driven storytelling, extended by surveying immersive data journalism and by analyzing immersive games, selected based on community reviews and tags. We present our methodology for the survey and discuss prominent themes that coalesce the knowledge we extracted from the literature, journalism, and games. These themes include, among others, the spatial embodiment of narration, the incorporation of the users and their context into narratives, and the balance between guiding the user versus promoting serendipity. Our discussion of these themes reveals research opportunities and challenges that will inform the design of immersive data-driven stories in the future.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Juli\u00e1n M\u00e9ndez"},{"email":null,"name":"Weizhou Luo"},{"email":null,"name":"Rufat Rzayev"},{"email":null,"name":"Wolfgang B\u00fcschel"},{"email":null,"name":"Raimund Dachselt"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Juli\u00e1n M\u00e9ndez"},{"email":null,"name":"Weizhou Luo"},{"email":null,"name":"Rufat Rzayev"},{"email":null,"name":"Wolfgang B\u00fcschel"},{"email":null,"name":"Raimund Dachselt"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"julian.mendez2@tu-dresden.de","name":"Juli\u00e1n M\u00e9ndez"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"julian.mendez2@tu-dresden.de","name":"Juli\u00e1n M\u00e9ndez"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.274048+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3531138","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"1a87c6dd-4c17-4b68-91d5-c59f2bb0fe4c","keywords":["Data visualization","Journalism","Reviews","Games","Libraries","Surveys","Media","Data analysis","Codes","Artificial intelligence"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"We followed the PRISMA methodology for scoping reviews, and provide both the codebook and all the analyzed papers, journal applications, and games with the corresponding coding to each of them.

However, the set-size effect when perceiving multiple SF based items remains unclear. While automatic feature extraction has been found to be less affected by set size (number of items in a group), higher-level processes for making perceptual decisions tend to require increased cognitive demand. To investigate the set-size effect on comparing integrated SF based items, we used a risk-based scenario to assess discrimination performance. Participants were asked to discriminate between pairs of maps containing multiple SF glyphs, in which each glyph represents one of four discrete levels (none, low, medium, high), forming an aggregate \u201crisk strength\u201d per map. The set size was also adjusted across conditions, ranging from small (3 items) to large (7 items). Discrimination sensitivity is modeled with a logistic function and response time with a mixed-effect linear model. Results show that smaller set sizes and lower overall strength enable more precise discrimination, with faster response times for larger differences between maps. Incorporating set size and overall strength into the logistic model, we found that these variables both independently and jointly influence discrimination sensitivity. We suggest these results point towards capacity-limited processes rather than purely automatic ensemble coding. Our findings highlight the importance of set size and overall signal strength when presenting multiple SF glyphs in data visualization.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"yiran.2.li@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Yiran Li"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"shan.shao@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Shan Shao"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"peter.baudains@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Peter Baudains"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"andrew.meso@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Andrew Meso"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"nickholliman@gmail.com","name":"Nick Holliman"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"alfie.abdulrahman@gmail.com","name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman"},{"affiliation":"Kings College London","email":"rita.borgo@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Rita Borgo"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"yiran.2.li@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Yiran Li"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"shan.shao@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Shan Shao"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"peter.baudains@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Peter Baudains"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"andrew.meso@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Andrew Meso"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"nickholliman@gmail.com","name":"Nick Holliman"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"alfie.abdulrahman@gmail.com","name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman"},{"affiliation":"Kings College London","email":"rita.borgo@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Rita Borgo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yiran.2.li@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Yiran Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yiran.2.li@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Yiran Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"1acd711b-69a4-486f-9955-0f6adb58292b","keywords":["Radial spatial frequency","Vizent glyph","set size","visual discrimination","aggregation","psychometric function"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1557-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU1Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.-mIPQ1Q4jGxAk_bAzXyEsxvtMViKvi956y_im0tvbWs","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1557-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=b0f2aa6a1ad4f4f0455db0a6a938797bd0b94e1321964f627604ae58fa3e775f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1557-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=64e7d8f97fc93c8258b0a2893af08693e0f8973d9205697e08490d64558d60cb","practitioners_statement":"UX / HCI researchers and designers of decision-support tools: Our evidence of capacity-limited read-out helps determine how many glyphs a dashboard can display before precision falls, guiding choices about interface complexity, glyph density, and progressive-reveal interactions.\n\nData scientists and analysts who communicate risk: Our task mirrors real-world comparisons in traffic, natural-hazard, and climate-impact mapping.

In this paper, we investigate the visualization of genomic data with a spatial component. First, we systematically survey how 3D genome models are used and depicted in computational biology. We analyze over 300 papers with figures that visualize 3D genomic data and categorize the methods for visual representation. From this survey, we derive a design space for visualizing 3D genome data, identifying common patterns and key properties such as representation, visual channels, and composition. We position these findings within an existing genomics visualization taxonomy, refining and extending existing classifications. Second, we augment Gosling, a declarative visualization grammar for genomics, to support 3D genomic data. Our integration enables expressive authoring of visualizations that connect traditional genome-mapped information with 3D genome models, emphasizing their spatial characteristics. To demonstrate its utility, we employ our extended grammar to recreate interactive examples, showcasing its ability to represent complex visual designs.

Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders\u2019 trust in systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different backgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models\u2019 behavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey explainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics. We conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools (LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how taxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for non-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between comprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they trust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is strongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations increase people\u2019s perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces trust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability visualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show that visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension, increase perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model bias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design, significantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high.

This is particularly important for those at higher health risks and their care providers, allowing for better risk interpretation which may lead to more informed decisions. However, the kinds of visualizations used to represent data may impart biases that influence data interpretation and decision making. Both continuous representations using bar charts and discrete representations using icon arrays are pervasive in health risk communication, but express the same quantities using fundamentally different visual paradigms. We conducted a series of studies to investigate how bar charts, icon arrays, and their layout (juxtaposed, explicit encoding, explicit encoding plus juxtaposition) affect the perception of value comparison and subsequent decision-making in health risk communication. Our results suggest that icon arrays and explicit encoding combined with juxtaposition can optimize for both accurate difference estimation and perceptual biases in decision making. We also found misalignment between estimation accuracy and decision making, as well as between low and high literacy groups, emphasizing the importance of tailoring visualization approaches to specific audiences and evaluating visualizations beyond perceptual accuracy alone. This research contributes empirically-grounded design recommendations to improve comparison in health risk communication and support more informed decision-making across domains.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"jadekandel@gmail.com","name":"Jade Kandel"},{"affiliation":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"liujiayi@unc.edu","name":"Jiayi Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"chint@cs.unc.edu","name":"Chin Tseng"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","name":"Danielle Szafir"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"jadekandel@gmail.com","name":"Jade Kandel"},{"affiliation":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"liujiayi@unc.edu","name":"Jiayi Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"chint@cs.unc.edu","name":"Chin Tseng"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","name":"Danielle Szafir"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jadekandel@gmail.com","name":"Jade Kandel"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jadekandel@gmail.com","name":"Jade Kandel"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"1e9e6140-6939-402f-8781-8420814824be","keywords":["Information Visualization","Graphical Perception","Health Risk Communication","Bar Chart","Icon Array","Composition"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/4nhtf/?view_only=b5168623250a44aa826ab027df42d87b","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1933-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTkzMy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.U7MBKOErdelB-IslBYRIm859yKuXOLh4e8pCNdjjcKY","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1933-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=02b706c4f2fc8dc6a1d2a3bbb76e332d95434844cbc24d0584e83271907c81fc","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1933-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=b5d1f99f76774b0088ba958d578d2e7eabbbd2c7a778813cf2146d7eb8a00add","practitioners_statement":"People interested in designing accessible visualizations and people in healthcare would be interested in reading this paper.

Understanding how LLMs internally represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification \u21d2 Interpretation \u21d2 Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest, interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs, ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM features.

Based on data from a 235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT, CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts (high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers) focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual data communication to enhance understanding.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"minsuk@gatech.edu","name":"Minsuk Chang"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"yao.wang@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Yao Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","name":"Huichen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"zhouyuanhong0510@gmail.com","name":"Yuanhong Zhou"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"andreas.bulling@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Andreas Bulling"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"minsuk@gatech.edu","name":"Minsuk Chang"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"yao.wang@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Yao Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","name":"Huichen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"zhouyuanhong0510@gmail.com","name":"Yuanhong Zhou"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"andreas.bulling@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Andreas Bulling"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"minsuk@gatech.edu","name":"Minsuk Chang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"minsuk@gatech.edu","name":"Minsuk Chang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"22ccb527-7a1d-49e1-81b8-9e4f335089e1","keywords":["Visualization Literacy Assessment","Visual Attention and Saliency","Visual Saliency Models"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/2crb9/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1490-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQ5MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDN9.TOjg6Ca6wD-bJXxcT1bB2AkjIc4pBHM4GEdLORzcO6M","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1490-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=aa59dd275cb60eaa4fc63854c9f7e3f8c935885bb45d7fe68d805a31a4f8e5e6","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1490-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=f6d9a25b0efc6512cef6cde34c3c3727e89a49643350e05118d6090dfc3be992","practitioners_statement":"Vision Scientists \u2013 The study shows how people with different visualization skills look at charts differently, strongly related to vision science.\n\nVisualization Designers / UX Researchers \u2013 The Lit2Sal and Sal2Lit models help create personalized visualizations that match users' skill levels, making charts more effective and reducing confusion.

To improve interpretability, existing methods extract a subset of rules for approximation using model reduction techniques. However, by focusing on the reduced rule set, these methods often lose fidelity and ignore anomalous rules that, despite their infrequency, play crucial roles in real-world applications. This paper introduces a scalable visual analysis method to explain tree ensemble classifiers that contain tens of thousands of rules. The key idea is to address the issue of losing fidelity by adaptively organizing the rules as a hierarchy rather than reducing them. To ensure the inclusion of anomalous rules, we develop an anomaly-biased model reduction method to prioritize these rules at each hierarchical level. Synergized with this hierarchical organization of rules, we develop a matrix-based hierarchical visualization to support exploration at different levels of detail. Our quantitative experiments and case studies demonstrate how our method fosters a deeper understanding of both common and anomalous rules, thereby enhancing interpretability without sacrificing comprehensiveness.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Zhen Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Yuan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jing Wu"},{"email":null,"name":"Changjian Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Yao Ming"},{"email":null,"name":"Fan Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Zhen Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Yuan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jing Wu"},{"email":null,"name":"Changjian Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Yao Ming"},{"email":null,"name":"Fan Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"thu.lz@outlook.com","name":"Zhen Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"thu.lz@outlook.com","name":"Zhen Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.695102+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3514115","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"2686600c-1989-405f-bf3e-34862f75517c","keywords":["Random forests","Visualization","Reduced order systems","Analytical models","Predictive models","Decision trees","Scalability","Credit cards","Organizations","Medical services"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"machine learning practitioner, machine learning user","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03164","program_paper_id":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3514115","title":"RuleExplorer: A Scalable Matrix Visualization for Understanding Tree Ensemble Classifiers","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"The burgeoning online video game industry has sparked intense competition among providers to both expand their user base and retain existing players, particularly within social interaction genres. To anticipate player churn, there is an increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models that focus on social interaction dynamics. However, the prevalent opacity of most ML algorithms poses a significant hurdle to their acceptance among domain experts, who often view them as \u201copaque models\u201d. Despite the availability of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques capable of elucidating model decisions, their adoption in the gaming industry remains limited. This is primarily because non-technical domain experts, such as product managers and game designers, encounter substantial challenges in deciphering the \u201cexplicit\u201d and \u201cimplicit\u201d features embedded within computational models. This study proposes a reliable, interpretable, and actionable solution for predicting player churn by restructuring model inputs into explicit and implicit features.

We observed that it often produces unstable results where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic elements\u2014specifically, initial projection positions and negative sampling\u2014impact UMAP results, we introduce \u201cghosts\u201d, or duplicates of data points representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a data point\u2019s projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our framework.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University","email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","name":"Myeongwon Jung"},{"affiliation":"Link\u00f6ping University","email":"tfujiwara@ucdavis.edu","name":"Takanori Fujiwara"},{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University","email":"jmjo@skku.edu","name":"Jaemin Jo"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University","email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","name":"Myeongwon Jung"},{"affiliation":"Link\u00f6ping University","email":"tfujiwara@ucdavis.edu","name":"Takanori Fujiwara"},{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University","email":"jmjo@skku.edu","name":"Jaemin Jo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","name":"Myeongwon Jung"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","name":"Myeongwon Jung"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"28a61ed9-3f15-4835-a688-e72b1fd6fa0c","keywords":["Dimensionality reduction","manifold learning","stochastic optimization","reliability","visualization","WebGPU"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1641-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTY0MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzZ9.BlrOI22Js6-7fJ3fLuY5KGKE7oa2uVEG0GcSva08R4Q","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1641-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=39d5bf6c5ab2e1b6c14dd928dc993ea2b920de7107f47624fe34a3f6baf8af3f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1641-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=e931dc6c052f10600e2871341ae0ffdba12accbac37d5aead2f6d2572f9831a4","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners who work with high-dimensional data and use dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and biologists, would be particularly interested in this paper.

However, current protocols yield relatively low success rates of about 20% per treatment cycle. A critical but complex and time-consuming step is the grading and selection of embryos for implantation. Although incubators with time-lapse microscopy have enabled computational analysis of embryo development, existing automated approaches either require extensive manual annotations or use opaque deep learning models that are hard for clinicians to validate and trust. We present EmbryoProfiler, a visual analytics system collaboratively developed with embryologists, biologists, and machine learning researchers to support clinicians in visually assessing embryo viability from time-lapse microscopy imagery. Our system incorporates a deep learning pipeline that automatically annotates microscopy images and extracts clinically interpretable features relevant for embryo grading. Our contributions include: (1) a semi-automatic, visualization-based workflow that guides clinicians through fertilization assessment, developmental timing evaluation, morphological inspection, and comparative analysis of embryos; (2) innovative interactive visualizations, such as cell-shape plots, designed to facilitate efficient analysis of morphological and developmental characteristics; and (3) an integrated, explainable machine learning classifier offering transparent, clinically-informed embryo viability scoring to predict live birth outcomes. Quantitative evaluation of our classifier and qualitative case studies conducted with practitioners demonstrate that EmbryoProfiler enables clinicians to make better-informed embryo selection decisions, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes in IVF treatments.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"jknittel@seas.harvard.edu","name":"Johannes Knittel"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"simonwarchol@g.harvard.edu","name":"Simon Warchol"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"jakob.troidl@googlemail.com","name":"Jakob Troidl"},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","email":"camelia_daniela.brumar@tufts.edu","name":"Camelia D.

Our findings highlight practical implications to inform visualization practitioners, and also provide a framework for leveraging LLMs to facilitate the design study process in visualization research.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"wangjiachen@zju.edu.cn","name":"Jiachen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"tianyizhang.2023@phdcs.smu.edu.sg","name":"Tianyi Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"tgdwyer@gmail.com","name":"Tim Dwyer"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"jiannanli@smu.edu.sg","name":"Jiannan Li"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"wangjiachen@zju.edu.cn","name":"Jiachen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"tianyizhang.2023@phdcs.smu.edu.sg","name":"Tianyi Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"tgdwyer@gmail.com","name":"Tim Dwyer"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"jiannanli@smu.edu.sg","name":"Jiannan Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"29656e00-00d7-4080-b589-2d7c838c72be","keywords":["Design Study","Large Language Models (LLMs)","Qualitative Study","Visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1207-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTIwNy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.Xm6xxvxQDptDJdkDmxBnwimXfCXJWcnFbdh0c-4JQJA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1207-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=6f89df6310b0276bda3ce670ba97cc6dbd78d1728d5f22d39aa2adafdbe8537f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1207-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=b95da05e47ecf620a46dac5bf1886fab55d93e60be2ed66153815ceecc0175c0","practitioners_statement":"Visualization Researchers, Data Scientists, UX/UI Designers, HCI Researchers, LLM Practioners/Researchers","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10024","program_paper_id":"1207","title":"Qualitative Study for LLM-assisted Design Study Process: Strategies, Challenges, and Roles","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"The rapid growth and availability of event sequence data across domains requires effective analysis and exploration methods to facilitate decision-making.

This paper presents a novel approach that generates cohesive and natural illustrations of vertical bar charts by integrating real-world object images as visual embellishments. The proposed pipeline takes an object image and a reference bar chart as input and produces an embellished bar chart that follows the structure of the input chart. To preserve chart integrity by maintaining the count, position, size, and order of data values, we introduce a strategy that anchors the top and bottom parts of the object image to the top and bottom of each bar while allowing the middle section to be filled by the generation model.

The manual labor required to create useful annotations is a barrier that keeps users from documenting their analysis, especially intermediate results. To address the needs of exploration and annotation alike, we propose integrating annotation with lens-based interactions, combining both with guidance. We investigate the exploration-annotation requirement space, identifying challenges and extracting five design requirements for annotation in exploration contexts. Based on this investigation, we designed ANNOLENS\u2014a concrete instantiation of such a system that lets users explore and annotate dimensionality-reduced multivariate data. It employs a dual-lens approach for contrastive exploration, using guidance to steer users toward interesting data subsets and attributes. Annotation is directly integrated into the lenses, letting users quickly annotate hunches and discoveries. Automated merging and linking serve to simplify annotation management and reduce disruptions. In a pilot study, we conducted a preliminary evaluation of our approach, which indicated that users find it easy to annotate data and were able to incorporate their knowledge and unique perspective into the process.

However, these visualizations and contextual images typically remain separated, limiting their combined narrative expressiveness and engagement. Achieving this is challenging due to the need for fine-grained alignment and creative ideation. To address this, we present SceneLoom, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-powered system that facilitates the coordination of data visualization with real-world imagery based on narrative intents. Through a formative study, we investigated the design space of coordination relationships between data visualization and real-world scenes from the perspectives of visual alignment and semantic coherence. Guided by the derived design considerations, SceneLoom leverages VLMs to extract visual and semantic features from scene images and data visualization, and perform design mapping through a reasoning process that incorporates spatial organization, shape similarity, layout consistency, and semantic binding. The system generates a set of contextually expressive, image-driven design alternatives that achieve coherent alignments across visual, semantic, and data dimensions. Users can explore these alternatives, select preferred mappings, and further refine the design through interactive adjustments and animated transitions to support expressive data communication. A user study and an example gallery validate SceneLoom's effectiveness in inspiring creative design and facilitating design externalization.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"lshenaj@connect.ust.hk","name":"Leixian Shen"},{"affiliation":"Fudan Univerisity","email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"22307130107@m.fudan.edu.cn","name":"Jiexiang Lan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"lshenaj@connect.ust.hk","name":"Leixian Shen"},{"affiliation":"Fudan Univerisity","email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"22307130107@m.fudan.edu.cn","name":"Jiexiang Lan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"2b7f7862-26fb-4ce7-81a9-01537d804ead","keywords":["Creativity Support","Data Communication","Scene Context","Vision-Language Model"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://lynnegao.me/scene-loom/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1058-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTA1OC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjY0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjR9.dFyrRTP2bMTPrF15IGaXaNRGpC9tXUxp9_KGy31ZQZc","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1058-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=c5cf13c0d10e33cbf9937da5338b182042f774f1060b151a8e8489b7234bdf4a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1058-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=d49f57c4a0c80c55dc2668f5b7054f3823207cd3f7011a62b2b6241ef9713bd3","practitioners_statement":"Data Journalists, Information Designers, Video Makers, Creative Technologists, and Researchers in Visualization, HCI, and VLM Applications","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16466","program_paper_id":"1058","title":"SceneLoom: Communicating Data with Scene Context","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We present interactive data-driven compute overlays for native and\nweb-based 3D geographic map applications based on WebGPU.\nOur data-driven overlays are generated in a multi-step compute\nworkfow from multiple data sources on the GPU.

While researchers have used fiber arts mediums to create exploratory projects, data visualization and physicalization research has largely not engaged with examples from this enormous and diverse community. We explore the pace of data textiles, or fiber arts that encode information, by surveying creators (i.e., data fiber artists) on their projects and processes. We create a corpus of 159 examples of data textiles and present a schema characterizing the data encoding methods used in these projects. We also gather insights into creators\u2019 data workflows as well as their motives and discoveries through making with their data. Creators of data textiles use distinct processes to map their data, building fabric from component structures and substructures while using material properties like color and texture. From diverse data-tracking procedures, creators use and relate to data in varied ways. Working on these pieces also contributes to the creators\u2019 personal growth and data understanding.

Previous research has relied on either interviewing a limited number of domain users or reviewing relevant application papers in the visualization community, neither of which provides comprehensive insight into visualizations in the wild of a specific domain. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the potential of using Large Language Models (LLM) to analyze visualization usage in domain literature. We use high-dimension (HD) data visualization in sing-cell transcriptomics as a test case, analyzing 1,203 papers that describe 2,056 HD visualizations with highly specialized domain terminologies (e.g., biomarkers, cell lineage). To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a multi-step, human-in-the-loop LLM workflow. Instead of relying solely on LLMs for end-to-end analysis, our workflow enhances analytical quality through 1) integrating image processing and traditional NLP methods to prepare well-structured inputs for three targeted LLM subtasks (i.e., translating domain terminology, summarizing analysis tasks, and performing categorization), and 2) establishing checkpoints for human involvement and validation throughout the process.\nThe analysis results was validated with expert interviews and a test set, revealing three often overlooked aspects in HD visualization: trajectories in HD spaces, inter-cluster relationships, and dimension clustering.\nThis research provides a stepping stone for future studies seeking to use LLMs to bridge the gap between visualization design and domain-specific usage.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"xinyi.liu@utexas.edu","name":"Xinyi Liu"},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","email":"nils@hms.harvard.edu","name":"Nils Gehlenborg"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"xinyi.liu@utexas.edu","name":"Xinyi Liu"},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","email":"nils@hms.harvard.edu","name":"Nils Gehlenborg"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"32bd145e-06bf-411a-af2e-109192108a7e","keywords":["High dimensional visualization; LLM-supported literature review; Visualization in the wild"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://hdvis.github.io","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1905-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTkwNS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.TswtYR2y7Q1Rq18g6yRk_vbMycBldnYtcwz7XLgUbQQ","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1905-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=664eac2f1add891def02b991197ef9125d9bcbce8e79f4f7739351a7286535a1","practitioners_statement":"Biologists and other domain practitioners new to visualization can use this paper to learn how visualizations are applied in their field and how to create more effective ones.\n\nVisualization designers can use the findings to develop tools that better align with the real-world needs and practices of domain users.","preprint_link":"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qtsak_v2?view_only=","program_paper_id":"1905","title":"Can LLMs Bridge Domain and Visualization?

However, such methods are sensitive to noise and minor fluctuations, leading to missed pattern occurrences. Conversely, machine learning (ML) approaches require abundant labeled examples, posing practical challenges. Our visual analytics approach enables domain experts to derive, test, and combine interval-based features to discriminate patterns and generate training data for ML algorithms.

While run-time optimizations such as caching and data tiling improve interaction latency, these approaches leave initial load performance unoptimized. In this work, we investigate _publish-time optimizations_ that shift computational work ahead of user sessions to accelerate both loading and interaction. We organize the space of publish-time optimizations into categories of data preparation, pre-computation of data assets for optimization, and pre-rendering; and then reason about tradeoffs in terms of time-to-render (TTR), time-to-activation (TTA), and storage cost (SC). To assess their effectiveness, we implement publish-time optimizations for the open-source Mosaic architecture and evaluate their impact across varied visualizations and dataset sizes. On average, publish-time strategies reduced rendering latency by 83.7% and activation latency by 33.3%, demonstrating their value for improving the performance of web-based visualizations.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.063302+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"32ebace7-cf30-462d-b6a4-40a3e39c6226","keywords":["scalable visualization","web visualization","visualization optimization","visualization systems","user interfaces"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic-publish","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1295-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyOTUtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY4fQ.vrWqs4ltHOSjM1midRK83vyViKGuM3AR-Woq1G0kpeY","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1295-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=41fe18cb82908eccf851255652c4800e3b01973660b58d45a6270b8b640da287","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners who author and/or deploy interactive web-based visualizations or visualization systems will find this paper the most relevant.

We first present a general framework, FEB (Fast Edge Bundling), utilizing spectral sparsification to improve the efficiency of existing bundling methods while maintaining a similar quality of bundling. We then present the FBQ (Fast Bundling Quality) framework for proxy bundle faithfulness metrics, to measure how FEB faithfully preserves the ground truth structure in the original edge bundling, with two variants, FBQ_JS (utilizing Jaccard Similarity) and  FBQ_SQ (utilizing sampling quality metrics). Extensive experiments using various real-world networks demonstrate the efficiency of the FEB framework, with 61% runtime improvement over the original edge bundling methods without sparsification, while maintaining a similar quality by FBQ quality metrics and visual comparison.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"xjia9238@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Xingjue Jiang"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"seokhee.hong@sydney.edu.au","name":"Seok-Hee Hong"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"amei2916@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Amyra Meidiana"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"xzen6984@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Xianyuan Zeng"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"xjia9238@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Xingjue Jiang"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"seokhee.hong@sydney.edu.au","name":"Seok-Hee Hong"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"amei2916@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Amyra Meidiana"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"xzen6984@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Xianyuan Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"seokhee.hong@sydney.edu.au","name":"Seok-Hee Hong"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"seokhee.hong@sydney.edu.au","name":"Seok-Hee Hong"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.278826+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"333107f7-56b6-4215-823a-2550e2a1c1e1","keywords":["Edge bundling","Spectral sparsification","Faithfulness metrics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1132-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMzItZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTk0NCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTQ0fQ.iMwWAsU1tVLAgTSM-ZtG889XudxsHjD5YGSB9HwwqeU","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1132-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=8941403ff7eae2b1b83b5c1ff12a72e8999e59a2325db4e633f1ce55e84355dd","practitioners_statement":"Data scientists, System biologists, and Sociologists using large and complex networks.\n\nThey can use the new framework for fast edge bundling to produce a faithful visualization of large and complex graphs, with fast runtime.","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1132","title":"Fast and Faithful Edge Bundling for Large and Complex Networks","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Embodiment shapes how users verbally express intent when interacting with data through speech interfaces in immersive analytics.

Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the gap between users\u2019 intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured Speech Input Uncertainty for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how uncertain users\u2019 speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data analysis tasks, phases, and Embodiment Reliance driven by the counts and types of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hsong02@cs.umd.edu","name":"Hyemi Song"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"mjohns28@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Matthew Johnson"},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"varshney@cs.umd.edu","name":"Amitabh Varshney"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hsong02@cs.umd.edu","name":"Hyemi Song"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"mjohns28@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Matthew Johnson"},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"varshney@cs.umd.edu","name":"Amitabh Varshney"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hsong02@cs.umd.edu","name":"Hyemi Song"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"hsong02@cs.umd.edu","name":"Hyemi Song"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"33454738-a9a9-4944-a27f-262d1da9f35d","keywords":["Embodiment","Natural Language Interaction (NLI)","Immersive Analytics","Speech Patterns","Semantic Entropy","User Intent","Speech Acts"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/sv4fn/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1747-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc0Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.s6fGM-5lFn9V8DO92XOoqD2bkIUDHuwi4Kye9nwCHXg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1747-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=93898a1dc269b9ecfce08c6aea960807d3aa4359eac17266104a8cc0b1714b79","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1747-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=291f8a6246b2504fe3e40fb8e7f1113944d169024258ba7cdafe402d6db88e62","practitioners_statement":"Researchers, Developers, Designers","preprint_link":"","program_paper_id":"1747","title":"Embodied Natural Language Interaction (NLI): Speech Input Patterns in Immersive Analytics","updated_at":"2025-10-31T08:49:09.283847+00:00"},{"abstract":"Affective visualization design is an emerging research direction focused on communicating and influencing emotion through visualization.

Through an analysis of a curated corpus of affective geovisualization designs using the Person-Process-Place (PPP) model from geographic theory, we derived a design taxonomy that characterizes a variety of methods for eliciting and enhancing emotions through geographic visualization. We also identified four underlying high-level design paradigms of affective geovisualization design (e.g., computational, anthropomorphic) that guide distinct approaches to linking geographic information with human experience.

To address these challenges, we propose an automated approach for generating optimal color encodings to enhance the perception of translucent charts. Our method harnesses color nameability to maximize the association between composite colors and their respective class labels. We introduce a color-name aware (CNA) optimization framework that generates maximally coherent color assignments and transparency settings while ensuring perceptual discriminability for all segments in the visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through crowdsourced experiments with composite histograms, showing how our technique can significantly outperform both standard and visualization-specific color blending models.

In climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis workflow that leverages a self organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs\u2014spatiotemporal time series\u2014into a distribution over a 2D space that captures the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach and its utility.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","email":"ykawakami@ucdavis.edu","name":"Yuya Kawakami"},{"affiliation":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography","email":"dcayan@ucsd.edu","name":"Daniel Cayan"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"dyuliu@ucdavis.edu","name":"Dongyu Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","email":"ykawakami@ucdavis.edu","name":"Yuya Kawakami"},{"affiliation":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography","email":"dcayan@ucsd.edu","name":"Daniel Cayan"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"dyuliu@ucdavis.edu","name":"Dongyu Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ykawakami@ucdavis.edu","name":"Yuya Kawakami"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ykawakami@ucdavis.edu","name":"Yuya Kawakami"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"34e579da-1d6a-4ba7-a6e1-4644a0d2c0b7","keywords":["Climate visual analytics","ensemble visualization","self-organizing maps"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1773-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc3My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.sIf_YCaRJ_o_33FDmafkuXv_2VgsOS-bOPjIOSDdo_o","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1773-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=3f5742421710c31280b32aec179459a7bde222720f406064f27246454c378685","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1773-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=39ae767ab325e18bf406c6378ac36fbdc83122c6cd042de49ec8757e9cc01b8e","practitioners_statement":"Climate scientists in particular would be interested to explore visual methods for analysis alongside often-used statistical methods.

We consider PCA under the assumption that the high-dimensional data points are equipped with Gaussian uncertainty. Several approaches to such uncertainty-aware PCA have been developed recently in the visualization community. Since PCA is a discontinuous map, a small uncertainty in the data points can result in a huge uncertainty in the projected points. We show that the uncertainty of the data points also creates uncertainty in the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that defines the PCA projection. We present a closed-form expression to quantify eigenvector uncertainty. Based on this, we propose a 3D glyph that supports the decision whether existing solutions for uncertainty-aware PCA are sufficient, or whether a more expensive sampling-based approach is required. We apply our approach to several test data sets.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"lukas.friesecke@ovgu.de","name":"Lukas Friesecke"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"christian.braune@ovgu.de","name":"Christian Braune"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"roessl@isg.cs.uni-magdeburg.de","name":"Christian Roessl"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"lukas.friesecke@ovgu.de","name":"Lukas Friesecke"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"christian.braune@ovgu.de","name":"Christian Braune"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"roessl@isg.cs.uni-magdeburg.de","name":"Christian Roessl"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"lukas.friesecke@ovgu.de","name":"Lukas Friesecke"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"lukas.friesecke@ovgu.de","name":"Lukas Friesecke"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"367cd3fe-b8ff-4bee-bd9f-ae8e51feeb9e","keywords":["PCA","dimensionality reduction","uncertainty visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/lfriesecke/uncertainty-aware-pca-revisited","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1838-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTgzOC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.01u2Umdkxw7JNk8WeHFbkfJEpkiN-895MM3jV8RO9Sk","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1838-cam-i10.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=7c35d5ba44a6027f96c8ea9f49148d384f1dbd81c0c44885ff444128d6772cb2","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1838-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=4afcc0a1de6420afe79507e5886c4084fdff7a391be459dde26a884b4c3a026b","practitioners_statement":"Data Scientists - We propose a 3D glyph hat supports the decision whether existing solutions for uncertainty-aware PCA are sufficient, or whether a more expensive sampling-based approach is required.

However, comparing stress distributions across multiple model variants remains challenging due to the complexity of stress fields, which are high-dimensional, unevenly distributed, and dependent on intricate geometric structures. Existing tools primarily support single-model analysis and lack dedicated functionalities for multi-model comparison. As a result, engineers must rely on manual, cognitively demanding visual inspections, making it difficult to systematically identify and interpret stress variations across design iterations. To address these limitations, we propose StressDiffVis, a visual analytics approach that facilitates stress field comparison across multiple structural models. StressDiffVis employs a volumetric representation to encode stress distributions while minimizing occlusion, enabling voxel-wise difference analysis for model comparison. To support localized analysis, we introduce model segmentation, grouping voxels with similar stress patterns across models. StressDiffVis integrates these techniques into an interactive interface with a tree view, organizing models by the iterative design process, and a comparison view, using a matrix layout for detailed comparisons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StressDiffVis through two case studies illustrating its utility in comparative stress analysis. In addition, expert interviews confirm its potential to enhance engineering workflows.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"zkdeng@scut.edu.cn","name":"Zikun Deng"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"sehanlinsong@mail.scut.edu.cn","name":"Hanlin Song"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"xiangch.05@outlook.com","name":"Xiang Chen"},{"affiliation":"Greater Bay Area National Center of Technology Innovation","email":"gaoshaowu@ncti-gba.cn","name":"Shaowu Gao"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"ycai@scut.edu.cn","name":"Yi Cai"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"zkdeng@scut.edu.cn","name":"Zikun Deng"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"sehanlinsong@mail.scut.edu.cn","name":"Hanlin Song"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"xiangch.05@outlook.com","name":"Xiang Chen"},{"affiliation":"Greater Bay Area National Center of Technology Innovation","email":"gaoshaowu@ncti-gba.cn","name":"Shaowu Gao"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"ycai@scut.edu.cn","name":"Yi Cai"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.772067+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"39db4241-5a8e-4bf7-abaf-b638cfbfee08","keywords":["Stress analysis","comparative visualization","volume visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1351-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTM1MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDF9.939qILiy7oJfqSsW8b56iVc_CfDhxJ0DR4MHh9nWkfs","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1351-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=11c9a5ed1976221c41860cd6a20ff186e0b53a0dd78a48126b80b8821e3a2916","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1351-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=df4ff9daf1b1186632bb416a8519dffeb5d573df52158528ec1eebb7d10e1b16","practitioners_statement":"This paper is relevant to structural engineers, CAE practitioners, and simulation scientists involved in iterative design and stress analysis.

The design of our architecture allows to flexibly cater to both cases simply by adapting our modular loss functions, effectively treating the different scenarios as flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised problems, respectively (with respect to the presence or absence of ground-truth flow). To the best of our knowledge, FLINT is the first approach to perform flow estimation from scientific ensembles, generating a corresponding flow field for each discrete timestep, even in the absence of original flow information. Additionally, FLINT produces high-quality temporal interpolants between scalar fields. FLINT employs several neural blocks, each featuring several convolutional and deconvolutional layers.

Recent work suggests that multi-agent systems (MAS) can mitigate hallucinations by enabling internal validation and cross-verification. However, learning effective MAS coordination strategies to mitigate hallucination remains challenging, particularly for newcomers, due to the wide range of coordination strategies and the lack of interactive, hands-on learning tools. To address this, we present The Agentopia Times, an educational game that teaches hallucination mitigation through active experimentation with MAS coordination strategies. The Agentopia Times simulates a newsroom where LLM agents collaborate to create data-driven narratives, with users tasked with adjusting communication protocols to manage hallucinated content. The game features a structured mapping between MAS coordination and familiar gameplay mechanics, providing immediate feedback on hallucination outcomes. Through use cases and preliminary user feedback, we demonstrate how The Agentopia Times enables users to explore and mitigate hallucination in MAS.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities","email":"lu000661@umn.edu","name":"Yilin Lu"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"du000288@umn.edu","name":"Shurui Du"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities","email":"lu000661@umn.edu","name":"Yilin Lu"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"du000288@umn.edu","name":"Shurui Du"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"lu000661@umn.edu","name":"Yilin Lu"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"lu000661@umn.edu","name":"Yilin Lu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.605934+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945535132700684","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3b5e9042-feed-4d23-814b-7242a997aea1","keywords":["LLM","visualization generation","educational game","LLM hallucination","Multi-Agent"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Visual-Intelligence-UMN/The-Agentopia-Times","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1222-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMjItZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY3fQ.zBmaWZa-gGhwfXB-2lz_3zRZ5TAFlsYT6_m9tXcsryc","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1222-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=6b8549cf82cfcb3aca639d64724bd7b8c2ffae6f0b7a8ec8575ebdb7c9abd059","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1222-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=01a9b9f707ca7e5d3dedbfe9666d1b18a31b99ce960c0dbd3eec2ef4e6dcc027","practitioners_statement":"Target Practitioners:\nThis work will interest AI educators, data science instructors, simulation scientists, LLM application developers, and visualization researchers who are involved in the development or teaching of multi-agent AI systems, human-AI interaction, or explainable AI.\n\nPractical Impact:\nPractitioners can apply the game-based learning framework introduced in THE AGENTOPIA TIMES to teach complex coordination strategies and how those strategies contribute to hallucination mitigation in multi-agent LLM systems through interactive experimentation.

However, there exists a knowledge gap regarding how dashboard designs impact user engagement, necessitating designers to rely on their design expertise. Saliency has been used to comprehend viewing behaviors and assess visualizations, yet existing saliency models are primarily designed for single-view visualizations. To address this, we conduct an eye-tracking study to quantify participants\u2019 viewing patterns on dashboards. We collect eye-movement data from 60 participants, each viewing 36 dashboards (16 representative dashboards shared across all and 20 unique to each participant), totaling 1,216 dashboards and 2,160 eye-movement data instances. Analysis of the data from 16 dashboards viewed by all participants provides insights into how dashboard objects and layout designs influence viewing behaviors. Our analysis confirms known viewing patterns and reveals new patterns related to dashboard layout designs. Using the eye-movement data and identified patterns, we develop a saliency model to predict viewing behaviors with dashboards. Compared to state-of-the-art models for single-view visualizations, our model demonstrates overall improvement in prediction performance for dashboards. Finally, we propose potential dashboard design guidelines, illustrate an application case, and discuss general scanning strategies along with limitations and future work.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Manling Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Yihan Hou"},{"email":null,"name":"Ling Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"email":null,"name":"Wei Zeng"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Manling Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Yihan Hou"},{"email":null,"name":"Ling Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Remco Chang"},{"email":null,"name":"Wei Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yhou073@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Yihan HOU"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yhou073@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Yihan HOU"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.642805+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3532497","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"3ba85378-08f5-4533-b7d1-a8734f3bf319","keywords":["Data visualization","Layout","Visualization","Data models","Solid modeling","Gaze tracking","Predictive models","Multitasking","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"We have the eye-tracking dataset and the code for model, which have publiced on OSF","pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"visualization/dashboard designer","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"[TVCG3532497]","title":"Dashboard Vision: Using Eye-Tracking to Understand and Predict Dashboard Viewing Behaviors","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"To understand multiplayer gameplay behavior in a bomb-laying game, this paper explores the visual representation of player movement and events using space-time cubes.

To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR optimization without compromising accuracy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"parkjeong02@snu.ac.kr","name":"Jeongin Park"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"dtngus0111@gmail.com","name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliation":"Yonsei University","email":"dhkim16@yonsei.ac.kr","name":"Dae Hyun Kim"},{"affiliation":"Inria-Saclay, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay","email":"sbshin90@cs.umd.edu","name":"Sungbok Shin"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"parkjeong02@snu.ac.kr","name":"Jeongin Park"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"dtngus0111@gmail.com","name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliation":"Yonsei University","email":"dhkim16@yonsei.ac.kr","name":"Dae Hyun Kim"},{"affiliation":"Inria-Saclay, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay","email":"sbshin90@cs.umd.edu","name":"Sungbok Shin"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","name":"Hyeon Jeon"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","name":"Hyeon Jeon"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3d30c2f2-5e29-4f5f-a3bc-05c9fb3e4ea0","keywords":["imensionality reduction","Structural complexity","High-dimensional data","Optimization","Dataset-adaptive workflow"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"We publicized the source code","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1019-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTAxOS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjU5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NTl9.UB8ZANe4CoT2L33Oqbu0v70o6cWrP8laaV0jhba2YC8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1019-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=4642d0aac0705abbabc576d7b828b1010e9cb32e0f3e0e22eefd85e15e8ab599","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1019-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=f050de6789071f3f922a793e4d09522a05623112800f9da72109e4f0f1771f8d","practitioners_statement":"Domain researchers using dimensionality reduction","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11984","program_paper_id":"1019","title":"Dataset-Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Many real-world datasets \u2014 from an artist's body of work to a person's social media history \u2014 exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods.

The intricate nature of high-dimensional features necessitates dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to explore alignment of multimodal embeddings. However, existing DR methods fail to account for cross-modal alignment metrics, resulting in severe occlusion of points with divergent metrics clustered together, inaccurate contour maps from over-aggregation, and insufficient support for multi-scale exploration. To address these problems, this paper introduces DKMap, a novel DR visualization technique for interactive exploration of multimodal embeddings through Dynamic Kernel enhanced projection. First, rather than performing dimensionality reduction and contour estimation sequentially, we introduce a kernel regression supervised t-SNE that directly integrates post-projection contour mapping into the projection learning process, ensuring cross-modal alignment mapping accuracy. Second, to enable multi-scale exploration with dynamic zooming and progressively enhanced local detail, we integrate validation-constrained \u03b1 refinement of a generalized t-kernel with quad-tree-based multi-resolution technique, ensuring reliable kernel parameter tuning without overfitting. DKMap is implemented as a multi-platform visualization tool, featuring a web-based system for interactive exploration and a Python package for computational notebook analysis. Quantitative comparisons with baseline DR techniques demonstrate DKMap\u2019s superiority in accurately mapping cross-modal alignment metrics. We further demonstrate generalizability and scalability of DKMap with three usage scenarios, including visualizing million-scale text-to-image corpus, comparatively evaluating generative models, and exploring a billion-scale pretraining dataset.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","name":"Yilin Ye"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"chenxiruan64@gmail.com","name":"Chenxi Ruan"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","email":"yuzhang94@outlook.com","name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"zkdeng@scut.edu.cn","name":"Zikun Deng"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"zengwei81@gmail.com","name":"Wei Zeng"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","name":"Yilin Ye"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"chenxiruan64@gmail.com","name":"Chenxi Ruan"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","email":"yuzhang94@outlook.com","name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"zkdeng@scut.edu.cn","name":"Zikun Deng"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"zengwei81@gmail.com","name":"Wei Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","name":"Yilin Ye"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","name":"Yilin Ye"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3d649242-7596-4300-84fe-793b6a69b69c","keywords":["Kernel Regression","Vision-language Alignment","Multimodal Embeddings","Interactive Exploration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/HKUST-CIVAL/DKMap","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1781-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc4MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.mIEkuipp1uuDChYcICrqdgZPNtoFBcSMQvvq4GqkYzw","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1781-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=8b80075555ac6b7f1a5dab2e1c9cedde3c9833d48c6eb791fa9107fb33c6469f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1781-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=5dd345267bdc364a9bdb91019245288c4b0273910c211bc7e71726c56ac84b55","practitioners_statement":"data scientists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1781","title":"DKMap: Interactive Exploration of Vision-Language Alignment in Multimodal Embeddings via Dynamic Kernel Enhanced Projection","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Visualization of large-scale time-dependent simulation data is crucial for domain scientists to analyze complex phenomena, but it demands significant I/O bandwidth, storage, and computational resources. To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"syao2@nd.edu","name":"Siyuan Yao"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"syao2@nd.edu","name":"Siyuan Yao"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"syao2@nd.edu","name":"Siyuan Yao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"syao2@nd.edu","name":"Siyuan Yao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3d97e8c0-6d8b-4fe5-aa06-3ddf284b1a45","keywords":["Volume visualization","novel view synthesis","scene segmentation","segment tracking","deformable Gaussian splatting"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1535-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUzNS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.EiKp6ljr8N-pX5aUmGDFoG3rW34Fei_dr1TCgGmEK-k","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1535-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=c97f51377ecc2e0190f6ee0cdc6e57033b26d99c7438299951131e7f9791e6d3","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1535-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=c58889b55ece2c985848c74c5d01943d6ab3c6caf37fe3b274e2f7d2733a322e","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners who would be interested in this paper:\n- Simulation scientists\n- Visualization researchers\n- Computer graphics and vision researchers\n- Medical imaging specialists\n- Data scientists working with 3D or time-varying data\n\nHow they can apply it:\n- Simulation scientists can visualize large, time-varying datasets in real time on low-end machines.\n- Visualization researchers can build on the segmentation and tracking methods for dynamic scenes.\n- Graphics and vision researchers can use the deformable 3D Gaussians for efficient scene representation.\n- Medical imaging specialists can adapt the segmentation methods for CT/MRI data.\n- Data scientists can apply the tracking tools to monitor changes in dynamic 3D datasets.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12667","program_paper_id":"1535","title":"VolSegGS: Segmentation and Tracking in Dynamic Volumetric Scenes via Deformable 3D Gaussians","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable visual analytics.

However, these techniques typically abstract away crucial spatial, positional, and morphological contexts, complicating interpretation and limiting insights. To address these limitations, we present SEAL, an interactive visual analytics system designed to bridge the gap between abstract 2D embeddings and their rich spatial imaging context. SEAL introduces a novel hybrid-embedding visualization that preserves image and morphological information while integrating critical high-dimensional feature data. By adapting set visualization methods, SEAL allows analysts to identify, visualize, and compare selections\u2014defined manually or algorithmically\u2014in both the embedding and original spatial views, facilitating a deeper understanding of the spatial arrangement and morphological characteristics of entities of interest. To elucidate differences between selected sets of items, SEAL employs a scalable surrogate model to calculate feature importance scores, identifying the most influential features governing the position of objects within embeddings. These importance scores are visually summarized across selections, with mathematical set operations enabling detailed comparative analyses. We demonstrate SEAL's effectiveness and versatility through three case studies: colorectal cancer tissue analysis with a pharmacologist, melanoma investigation with a cell biologist, and exploration of sky survey data with an astronomer. These studies underscore the importance of integrating image context into embedding spaces when interpreting complex imaging datasets.

However, current approaches for designing eligibility criteria have limitations to support interactive exploration of the large space of eligibility criteria. They also ignore incorporating detailed characteristics from the original electronic health record (EHR) data for criteria refinement. To address these limitations, we proposed TrialCompass, a visual analytics system integrating a novel workflow, which can empower clinicians to iteratively explore the vast space of eligibility criteria through knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches. TrialCompass supports history-tracking to help clinicians trace the evolution of their adjustments and decisions when exploring various forms of data (i.e., eligibility criteria, outcome metrics, and detailed characteristics of original EHR data) through these two approaches. This feature can help clinicians comprehend the impact of eligibility criteria on outcome metrics and patient characteristics, which facilitates systematic refinement of eligibility criteria. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TrialCompass in providing insights into designing eligibility criteria for septic shock and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We also discussed the research prospects of applying visual analytics to clinical trials.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America & Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)","email":"wangxbzb@gmail.com","name":"Xingbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"wangjiachen@zju.edu.cn","name":"Jiachen Wang"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"suffvier@gmail.com","name":"Xiaofu Jin"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"szh@connect.ust.hk","name":"Zhonghua SHENG"},{"affiliation":"Weill Cornell Medical College","email":"zhx2005@med.cornell.edu","name":"Zhenxing Xu"},{"affiliation":"Weill Cornell Medical College","email":"sur4002@med.cornell.edu","name":"Suraj Rajendran"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliation":"Weill Cornell Medicine","email":"few2001@med.cornell.edu","name":"Fei Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America & Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)","email":"wangxbzb@gmail.com","name":"Xingbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"wangjiachen@zju.edu.cn","name":"Jiachen Wang"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"suffvier@gmail.com","name":"Xiaofu Jin"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"szh@connect.ust.hk","name":"Zhonghua SHENG"},{"affiliation":"Weill Cornell Medical College","email":"zhx2005@med.cornell.edu","name":"Zhenxing Xu"},{"affiliation":"Weill Cornell Medical College","email":"sur4002@med.cornell.edu","name":"Suraj Rajendran"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliation":"Weill Cornell Medicine","email":"few2001@med.cornell.edu","name":"Fei Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3f0a5ad9-2440-47b4-a741-f6b92c58bf8d","keywords":["Visual Analytics","Healthcare","Clinical Trials","Decision Making","Electronic Health Record (EHR)"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1291-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTI5MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.M8s7_u2IK_2vA9QF7LV2C3cieOtZRWA0NHbhKhiGQDo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1291-cam-i10.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=da86199a58638fda81053651a0b1a91bf99fbc3686f8459bc335419984e62df4","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1291-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=c3e8d547bcee3df2fbd8556587395ac642b4cab7c0d2a220216a65ab7c69331e","practitioners_statement":"Clinicians and clinical researchers, HCI Researchers, Visualization Researchers","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12298","program_paper_id":"1291","title":"TrialCompass: Visual Analytics for Enhancing the Eligibility Criteria Design of Clinical Trials","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"changjianchen@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Changjian Chen"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"wangpengcheng@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Pengcheng Wang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"feilv@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Fei Lyu"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"ztang@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Zhuo Tang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"yanglixt@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Li Yang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"wanglong8591@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Long Wang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"caiyong911@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Yong Cai"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"feng_yu@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Feng Yu"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"lkl@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Kenli Li"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"changjianchen@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Changjian Chen"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"wangpengcheng@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Pengcheng Wang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"feilv@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Fei Lyu"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"ztang@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Zhuo Tang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"yanglixt@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Li Yang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"wanglong8591@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Long Wang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"caiyong911@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Yong Cai"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"feng_yu@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Feng Yu"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"lkl@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Kenli Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wangpengcheng@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Pengcheng Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"wangpengcheng@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Pengcheng Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"4009fec8-7d38-4e00-9e7d-f9493fb32941","keywords":["Hybrid rice breeding","dual projection","genomic prediction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1645-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTY0NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzZ9.uaKvjzjNijMP5kNOEVRWy-mIk2sUvwJj34bXlLCdZjQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1645-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=f84d91fca5c71d4acee2efd8fb9759cd320f6d864eecafcabecf9c79047a7d56","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1645-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=59efd74a64f5a0e2dafd87795bfb446a43ad5d80494d1b63df08063d4298ab29","practitioners_statement":"This paper on hybrid rice breeding, is relevant to bioinformaticians and data scientists.

While super-resolution is an efficient post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion super-resolution modules learn degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details. Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific simulations.

To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics approach that integrates hierarchical clustering and process mining techniques to support analysts in exploring unstructured, large interaction sequence data. Our system employs a tailored dynamic time warping-based similarity measure to enable comparison of interaction sequences. Based on the sequence similarities, we provide stepwise, interactive navigation of clustering results with contextual visual cues for refinement and validation. We further apply process mining to characterize derived clusters. Through these hierarchical clustering and process mining steps, analysts can progressively uncover meaningful interaction patterns while utilizing visual guidance and incorporating domain expertise.

These biosignals, streamed through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment, filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field shaped by nonhuman cognition.

This highlights the need for intelligent assistance mechanisms.\nHowever, even the latest LLM-assisted VA systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting.  The agent autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further exploration.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan Univerisity","email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"3504936154@qq.com","name":"Xueli Shu"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"flwfdd@gmail.com","name":"Liwen Fan"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","email":"yuzhang94@outlook.com","name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Fudan Univerisity","email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"3504936154@qq.com","name":"Xueli Shu"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"flwfdd@gmail.com","name":"Liwen Fan"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","email":"yuzhang94@outlook.com","name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"47c46990-8edb-4014-be27-c1c07f128d60","keywords":["Visual analytics","mixed-initiative","large language model","interface agent","proactive agent","human-AI collaboration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1045-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTA0NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjYxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjF9.ioTHCDTYphNutdQJB7qROsJMPAXYI2P50u1SjY2GWcA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1045-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=1fc7160b71987616b9720f054e1db0dff1fcab316da453a52850c1efec080c2b","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1045-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=eb4642447eacb7f0f7794d1249b0b31758891b51c5ce1f0f45f67e17b843378f","practitioners_statement":"Algorithm developer,  LLM application developer, Visual analyst, Data scientist, Data Manager, HCI and Visual analyst researcher","preprint_link":"https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.18165","program_paper_id":"1045","title":"ProactiveVA: Proactive Visual Analytics with LLM-based UI Agent","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"As AI systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, enabling users to accurately interpret model behavior is critical. While AI explanations are readily available, users often struggle to reason effectively with these explanations, limiting their ability to validate or learn from AI decisions. To address this gap, we introduce Reverse Mapping, a novel approach that enhances visual explanations by incorporating user-derived insights back into the explanation workflow.

Analyzing such ambiguous samples in large-scale datasets is crucial for practical applications, such as diagnosing machine learning models. A promising method to support such analysis is through hierarchical cluster-aware grid visualizations, which offer high space efficiency and clear cluster perception. However, existing cluster-aware grid layout methods cannot clarify ambiguity among fuzzy clusters, which limits their effectiveness in fuzzy cluster analysis. To tackle this issue, we introduce a hierarchical fuzzy-cluster-aware grid layout method that supports hierarchical exploration of large-scale datasets. Throughout the hierarchical exploration, it is crucial to facilitate fuzzy cluster analysis while maintaining visual continuity for users. To achieve this, we propose a two-step optimization strategy for enhancing cluster perception, clarifying ambiguity, and preserving stability during the exploration. The first step is to create cluster-aware partitions, where each partition corresponds to a cluster. This step focuses on enhancing cluster perception and maintaining the previous shapes and positions of clusters to preserve stability at the cluster level. The second step is to generate a grid layout for each partition. In addition to placing similar samples together, this step also places ambiguous samples near the boundaries to clarify ambiguity and reveal the root causes of their occurrences and maintains the relative positions of the samples in the same cluster to preserve stability at the sample level. Several quantitative experiments and a use case are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our method in analyzing large-scale datasets, especially in fuzzy cluster analysis.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Yuxing Zhou"},{"email":null,"name":"Changjian Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Zhiyang Shen"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiangning Zhu"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiashu Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Yuxing Zhou"},{"email":null,"name":"Changjian Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Zhiyang Shen"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiangning Zhu"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiashu Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Weikai Yang"},{"email":null,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jszhouyuxing@gmail.com","name":"Yuxing Zhou"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jszhouyuxing@gmail.com","name":"Yuxing Zhou"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.274048+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3566558","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"4a794224-d35b-4998-91b4-ec7982dbd26c","keywords":["Layout","Power system stability","Thermal stability","Optimization","Data visualization","Visualization","Training","Stability criteria","Shape","Interviews"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data scientists would be interested in our paper.

The substantial variability in the categories and structures of labeled objects leads to diverse label layouts. Recent single-model learning-based solutions in label placement struggle to capture fine-grained differences between these layouts, which in turn limits their performance. In addition, although human designers often consult previous works to gain design insights, existing label layouts typically serve merely as training data, limiting the extent to which embedded design knowledge can be exploited. To address these challenges, we propose a mixture of cluster-guided experts (MoCE) solution for label placement. In this design, multiple experts jointly refine layout features, with each expert responsible for a specific cluster of layouts. A cluster-based gating function assigns input samples to experts based on representation clustering. We implement this idea through the Label Placement Cluster-guided Experts (LPCE) model, in which a MoCE layer integrates multiple feed-forward networks (FFNs), with each expert composed of a pair of FFNs. Furthermore, we introduce a retrieval augmentation strategy into LPCE, which retrieves and encodes reference layouts for each input sample to enrich its representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LPCE achieves superior performance in label placement, both quantitatively and qualitatively, surpassing a range of state-of-the-art baselines.

However, mapping the relationship between design choices and reader conclusions often requires labor-intensive crowdsourced studies, generating large corpora of free-response text for analysis. To address this challenge, we explored alternative scalable research methodologies to assess chart affordances. We test four elicitation methods from human-subject studies: free response, visualization ranking, conclusion ranking, and salience rating, and compare their effectiveness in eliciting reader interpretations of line charts, dot plots, and heatmaps. Overall, we find that while no method fully replicates affordances observed in free-response conclusions, combinations of ranking and rating methods can serve as an effective proxy at a broad scale. The two ranking methodologies were influenced by participant bias towards certain chart types and the comparison of suggested conclusions. Rating conclusion salience could not capture the specific variations between chart types observed in the other methods. To supplement this work, we present a case study with GPT-4o, exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) to elicit human-like chart interpretations. This aligns with recent academic interest in leveraging LLMs as proxies for human participants to improve data collection and analysis efficiency. GPT-4o performed best as a human proxy for the salience rating methodology but suffered from severe constraints in other areas.

Recent research has proposed various multidimensional TFs to utilize diverse attributes extracted from volume data for controlling individual voxel rendering. Although multidimensional TFs enhance the ability to segregate data, manipulating various attributes for the rendering is cumbersome. In contrast, low-dimensional TFs are more beneficial as they are easier to manage, but separating volume data during rendering is problematic. This paper proposes a novel approach, a two-level transfer function, for rendering volume data by reducing TF dimensions. The proposed technique involves extracting multidimensional TF attributes from volume data and applying t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to the TF attributes for dimensionality reduction. The two-level transfer function combines the classical 2D TF and t-SNE TF in the conventional direct volume rendering pipeline. The proposed approach is evaluated by comparing segments in t-SNE TF and rendering images using various volume datasets. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively allow us to manipulate multidimensional attributes easily while maintaining high visualization quality in volume rendering.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Sangbong Yoo"},{"email":null,"name":"Seokyeon Kim"},{"email":null,"name":"Yun Jang"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Sangbong Yoo"},{"email":null,"name":"Seokyeon Kim"},{"email":null,"name":"Yun Jang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"usangbong@gmail.com","name":"Sangbong Yoo"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"usangbong@gmail.com","name":"Sangbong Yoo"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.84764+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3484471","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"51452519-94bc-439f-9dc5-3db3fac8080a","keywords":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","Histograms","Image color analysis","Self-organizing feature maps","Dimensionality reduction","Data visualization","Visualization","Image segmentation","Feature extraction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Scientific visualization practitioners.

We analyse 47 papers from 33 Human-Computer Interaction and Visualisation venues and identify six dimensions of a design space of in-situ running visualisations. Our analysis of this design space highlights an emerging trend: a shift from on-body, peripersonal visualisations (i.e., in the space within direct reach, such as visualisations on a smartwatch or a mobile phone display) towards extrapersonal displays (i.e., in the space beyond immediate reach, such as visualisations in immersive augmented reality displays) that integrate data in the runner\u2019s surrounding environment. We explore this opportunity by conducting a series of workshops with 10 active runners in total, eliciting design concepts for running visualisations and interactions beyond conventional 2D displays. We find that runners show a strong interest for visualisation designs that favour more context-aware, interactive, and unobtrusive experiences that seamlessly integrate with their run. These findings inform a set of design considerations for future immersive running visualisations and highlight directions for further research.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Queensland","email":"leon.li.ang@foxmail.com","name":"Ang Li"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"cperin@uvic.ca","name":"Charles Perin"},{"affiliation":"University of Queensland","email":"g.demartini@uq.edu.au","name":"Gianluca Demartini"},{"affiliation":"University of Queensland","email":"viller@acm.org","name":"Stephen Viller"},{"affiliation":"The University of Queensland","email":"j.knibbe@uq.edu.au","name":"Jarrod Knibbe"},{"affiliation":"The University of Queensland","email":"m.cordeil@uq.edu.au","name":"Maxime Cordeil"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Queensland","email":"leon.li.ang@foxmail.com","name":"Ang Li"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"cperin@uvic.ca","name":"Charles Perin"},{"affiliation":"University of Queensland","email":"g.demartini@uq.edu.au","name":"Gianluca Demartini"},{"affiliation":"University of Queensland","email":"viller@acm.org","name":"Stephen Viller"},{"affiliation":"The University of Queensland","email":"j.knibbe@uq.edu.au","name":"Jarrod Knibbe"},{"affiliation":"The University of Queensland","email":"m.cordeil@uq.edu.au","name":"Maxime Cordeil"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"leon.li.ang@foxmail.com","name":"Ang Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"leon.li.ang@foxmail.com","name":"Ang Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"54daa89a-c0e5-4d1e-9891-4ce10711d2f9","keywords":["Running","Jogging; Survey","Taxonomy; Human-Subjects Qualitative Studies; Personal Visual Analytics; Mobile; Augmented/Mixed/Extended Reality","Immersive"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1017-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTAxNy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjcxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NzF9.TUO98r5xgNoEKPD6lUKn7ppg8P3JL9EPnFkE4-Q4K8I","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1017-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=fba6b3e55d7b841abdc4fe55068847c32c6740e38ccda96239881105c260a381","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1017-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a741adabb7607614c1de675b89a5a3e65941e7e685d6734424014d7d2b44dab4","practitioners_statement":"This paper is particularly relevant for practitioners in human-computer interaction (HCI), immersive technology designers, sports technology developers, visualisation specialists, and UX designers who aim to enhance user experiences in physical activities such as running.

However, uncertainty in such fields is typically visualized using derived scalar attributes or tensor glyph representations, which often fail to capture the global behavior. Recent advances have introduced uncertain topological features for tensor field ensembles by focusing on degenerate tensor locations. Yet, mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces and arbitrary mode surfaces are essential to a comprehensive understanding of tensor field topology. In this work, we present a generalization of uncertain degenerate tensor features to uncertain mode surfaces of arbitrary mode values, encompassing uncertain degenerate tensor lines as a special case. Our approach supports both surface and line geometries, forming a unified framework for analyzing uncertain mode-based topological features in tensor field ensembles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several real-world simulation datasets from engineering and materials science.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"RWTH Aachen University","email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"RWTH Aachen University","email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"gerrits@vis.rwth-aachen.de","name":"Tim Gerrits"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.063302+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"565a0b31-3df7-4d49-859a-2a96dda32a65","keywords":["Second-Order Tensors","Symmetric Tensors","Tensor Topology","Tensor Mode","Uncertainty"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1108-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMDgtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM4fQ.KSqPMwwk_cP6JQxRIISJLT5_RkfMypfcMzTj2NZVut4","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1108-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=5b1b1f8061e26724a836a0ffffd9ba0a96fb82d2c3c3f4b311337a38001d2d6e","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners working with symmetric second-order tensor data, e.g., simulation scientists and medical personell, are provided with a novel visualization tool for the analysis of uncertain topological features in tensor field ensembles.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23406","program_paper_id":"1108","title":"Uncertain Mode Surfaces in 3D Symmetric Second-Order Tensor Field Ensembles","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA) have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation.

This has led to the development of new techniques for street and pedestrian network visualization, expanding possibilities for effective data presentation and interpretation. Despite their increasing adoption, there is no established design framework to guide the creation of these visualizations while addressing the diverse requirements of various domains. When exploring a feature of interest, domain experts often need to transform, integrate, and visualize a combination of thematic data (e.g., demographic, socioeconomic, pollution) and physical data (e.g., zip codes, street networks), often spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. This not only complicates the process of visual data exploration and system implementation for developers but also creates significant entry barriers for experts who lack a background in programming. With this in mind, in this paper, we reviewed 45 studies utilizing street-overlaid visualizations to understand how they are applied in practice. Through qualitative coding of these visualizations, we analyzed three key aspects of street and pedestrian network visualization usage: their analytical purposes, the visualization approaches employed, and the data sources used in their creation. Building on this design space, we introduce StreetWeave, a declarative grammar for designing custom visualizations of multivariate spatial network data across multiple resolutions. We demonstrate how StreetWeave can be used to create various street-overlaid visualizations, enabling effective exploration and analysis of spatial data.

Computing and storing connectivity information is a major bottleneck for visualization algorithms, affecting both time and memory performance. Recent task-parallel data structures address this by precomputing connectivity information at runtime while the analysis algorithm executes, effectively hiding computation costs and improving performance. However, existing approaches are CPU-bound, forcing the data structure and analysis algorithm to compete for the same computational resources, limiting potential speedups. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel task-parallel approach optimized for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. Specifically, we offload the computation of mesh connectivity information to GPU threads, enabling CPU threads to focus on executing the visualization algorithm. Following this paradigm, we propose GPU-Aided Localized data structurE (GALE), the first open-source CUDA-based data structure designed for heterogeneous task parallelism. Experiments on two 20-core CPUs and an NVIDIA V100 GPU show that GALE achieves up to 2.7\u00d7 speedup over state-of-the-art localized data structures while maintaining memory efficiency.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"liu.12722@osu.edu","name":"Guoxi Liu"},{"affiliation":"Clemson University","email":"tlranda@clemson.edu","name":"Thomas Randall"},{"affiliation":"Clemson University","email":"rge@clemson.edu","name":"Rong Ge"},{"affiliation":"Clemson University","email":"fiurici@clemson.edu","name":"Federico Iuricich"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"liu.12722@osu.edu","name":"Guoxi Liu"},{"affiliation":"Clemson University","email":"tlranda@clemson.edu","name":"Thomas Randall"},{"affiliation":"Clemson University","email":"rge@clemson.edu","name":"Rong Ge"},{"affiliation":"Clemson University","email":"fiurici@clemson.edu","name":"Federico Iuricich"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"liu.12722@osu.edu","name":"Guoxi Liu"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"liu.12722@osu.edu","name":"Guoxi Liu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"5cec6278-7356-4658-8125-0dc6b65f8b08","keywords":["Data structure","unstructured mesh","topological data analysis","parallel computation","GPU algorithm"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/zxm4w","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1512-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUxMi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.lNBQmlBKrzZ5taYKrqsLiE38nd5uncN6AxmMMZkOvWQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1512-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=d4aa04dc994620d0178616847fbc5feaf755a8c05f14282a50503791fa2b89ad","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1512-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=93214ffa238f85c3845fcb994f3839cfbdddf00150e5164f4f5570f0f819637e","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners aiming to accelerate unstructured mesh analysis\u2014whether for real-time visualization, scientific simulation, or large-scale data processing\u2014can leverage GALE\u2019s heterogeneous task-parallel design to overcome traditional CPU-bound bottlenecks.

We collected VC scores through a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment involving 349 participants and 1,800 visualization images. We then examined how these scores align with 12 image-based metrics spanning pixel-based and statistic-information-theoretic (clutter), color, shape, and our two new object-based metrics (meaningful-color-count (MeC) and text-to-ink ratio (TiR)). Our results show that both low-level edges and high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; the number of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations. Second, feature congestion, a statistical information-theoretic metric capturing color and texture patterns, is the strongest predictor of perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same continuous color/texture stimuli; edge density effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a bell-curve effect for texts: increasing TiR initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further text increases VC. Our quantification model is also interpretable - enabling metric-based explanations - grounded in the VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual responses.

While recent literature underscores the value of guidance, a lack of clear explanations to motivate system interventions may still negatively impact guidance effectiveness. Hence, guidance-enhanced VA approaches require meticulous design, demanding contextual adjustments for developing appropriate explanations. Our article discusses the concept of explainable guidance and how it impacts the user\u2013system relationship\u2014specifically, a user's trust in guidance within the VA process. We subsequently propose a model that supports the design of explainability strategies for guidance in VA. The model builds upon flourishing literature in explainable AI, available guidelines for developing effective guidance in VA systems, and accrued knowledge on user\u2013system trust dynamics. Our model responds to challenges concerning guidance adoption and context-effectiveness by fostering trust through appropriately designed explanations. To demonstrate the model's value, we employ it in designing explanations within two existing VA scenarios.

Analyzing tactics in these scenarios is essential for gaining insights into game processes and improving combat behaviors. The decision-making data in team-based combat include character actions, movement trajectories, and event sequences. Existing studies face challenges in visualizing and analyzing combat tactics due to the complexity and the multifaceted characteristics of the decision-making data. To address these challenges, we introduce TactiVis, a visual analytics system designed for analyzing combat decision-making behavior. Using MOBA game as a representative case of team-based combat, TactiVis adopts a macro-to-micro tactics visual analytics framework consisting of three stages: match-level analysis, event-level understanding, and character-level comparison. In the TactiVis system, we introduce the v-storyline visualization, which encodes positions along the vertical axis to reveal tactical patterns. Case studies and a usability study demonstrate the utility and usability of TactiVis for helping analysts understand combat patterns and analyze tactics.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"3120215511@bit.edu.cn","name":"Hancheng Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"liguozhengsdu@gmail.com","name":"Guozheng Li"},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University","email":"lumin.vis@gmail.com","name":"Min Lu"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Normal University","email":"jinchengli@bnu.edu.cn","name":"Jincheng Li"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"liuchi02@gmail.com","name":"Chi Harold Liu"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"3120215511@bit.edu.cn","name":"Hancheng Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"liguozhengsdu@gmail.com","name":"Guozheng Li"},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University","email":"lumin.vis@gmail.com","name":"Min Lu"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Normal University","email":"jinchengli@bnu.edu.cn","name":"Jincheng Li"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"liuchi02@gmail.com","name":"Chi Harold Liu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"guozhg.li@gmail.com","name":"Guozheng Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"guozhg.li@gmail.com","name":"Guozheng Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"5f806c3f-27b1-47e9-81ce-9255b7532d0f","keywords":["Team-based combat","storyline visualization","MOBA games","tactic analysis."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1897-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTg5Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.phqcoqqddmEmjvX8DfrsFJL5bzy5VR0u4p-opLiRSjo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1897-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=28b1b82ed5b21bdfe7952143ac4160cd12414f3fd982b7ab9d0e7e7729c8d05a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1897-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=95ca07954c8334dcbbcdc4474af2ed1732615445f1cca0a7990b96bb086865af","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners such as game analysts, AI or reinforcement learning researchers would be interested in the paper.

To highlight and filter data, users indicate values or intervals of interest. Such selections may span multiple components, combine in complex ways, and require optimizations to ensure low-latency updates. We describe Mosaic Selections, a model for representing, managing, and optimizing user selections, in which one or more filter predicates are added to queries that request data for visualizations and input widgets. By analyzing both queries and selection predicates, Mosaic Selections enable automatic optimizations, including pre-aggregating data to rapidly compute selection updates. We contribute a formal description of our selection model and optimization methods, and their implementation in the open-source Mosaic architecture. Benchmark results demonstrate orders-of-magnitude latency improvements for selection-based optimizations over unoptimized queries and existing optimizers for the Vega language. The Mosaic Selection model provides infrastructure for flexible, interoperable filtering across multiple visualizations, alongside automatic optimizations to scale to millions and even billions of records.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.772067+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"603070d4-693a-4aec-8b08-632a59a24c59","keywords":["scalable visualization","interactive selection","multiple coordinated views","brushing and linking","user interfaces"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic-selection-benchmarks","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1313-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTMxMy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDF9.rsrZ1WZFt2qnjsrTcKKfaI-_ub8r4UNonguKKcb_6Pk","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1313-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=64ed82ebecff23cf3350701e21edee9776555e0f7da3a078d243b292f4d6070d","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1313-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=d820370f98bd392c2c6c7b6f522fc8d19823eb8a8216166400cb093e98c4a4fb","practitioners_statement":"Visualization developers, data system developers, and data engineers could apply the techniques in this paper to provide scalable, interactive data interfaces.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19690","program_paper_id":"1313","title":"Mosaic Selections: Managing and Optimizing User Selections for Scalable Data Visualization Systems","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web, retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"snyderl@cs.washington.edu","name":"Luke S.

Although patterns have long been used for data encoding and continue to be valuable today, their conceptual foundations are precarious: the concepts and terminology used across the research literature and in practice are inconsistent, making it challenging to use patterns effectively and to conduct research to inform their use. To address this problem, we conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary literature review that clarifies ambiguities around the use of pattern and texture. As a result, we offer a new consistent treatment of pattern as a composite visual variable composed of structured groups of graphic primitives that can serve as marks for encoding data individually and collectively. This new and widely applicable formulation opens a sizable design space for the visual variable pattern, which we formalize as a new system comprising three sets of variables: the spatial arrangement of primitives, the appearance relationships among primitives, and the retinal visual variables that characterize individual primitives.

Changing size from small scale (e.g., small figures in a paper) to large scale (e.g., large figures in a slide presentation) is straightforward for visualizations that have solid colored regions, but can be more complicated for visualizations with heterogeneous textures because there are multiple ways to scale textures\u2014zooming or repeating texture elements.

To fill the research gap, we first extract semantic-meaningful actions to represent the execution behaviors specified in smart contract bytecodes, which are derived from a literature review and in-depth interviews with domain experts. We then propose PonziLens+, a novel visual analytic approach that provides an intuitive and reliable analysis of Ponzi-scheme-related features within these execution behaviors. PonziLens+ has three visualization modules that intuitively reveal all potential behaviors of a smart contract, highlighting fraudulent features across three levels of detail. It can help smart contract investors and auditors achieve confident identification of any smart Ponzi schemes. We conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 domain experts and common investors to evaluate PonziLens+.

When visualizing large and dense discrete point samples, scatterplots and dot density maps often suffer from overplotting, and density plots are commonly employed to provide aggregated views while revealing underlying structures. Yet, in such density plots, existing illumination models may produce color distortion and hide details in low-density regions, making it challenging to look up density values, compare them, and find outliers. The key novelty in this work includes (i) a visualization-driven illumination model that inherently supports density-plot-specific analysis tasks and (ii) a new image composition technique to reduce the interference between the image shading and the color-encoded density values.

Although visualization research has broadened criteria for effective design, governing\nparadigms privilege the accurate and efficient transmission of data. Drawing on theory from linguistic anthropology, we argue that such approaches\u2014focused on encoding and decoding propositional content\u2014cannot fully account for how people engage with visualizations and why particular visualizations might invite adversarial or receptive responses. In this paper, we present evidence that data visualizations communicate not only semantic, propositional meaning\u2014meaning about data\u2014but also social, indexical meaning\u2014meaning beyond data. From a series of ethnographically-informed interviews, we document how readers make rich and varied assessments of a visualization\u2019s \u201cvibes\u201d\u2014inferences about the social provenance of a visualization based on its design features. Furthermore, these social attributions have the power to influence reception, as readers\u2019 decisions about how to engage with a visualization concern not only content, or even aesthetic appeal, but also their sense of alignment or disalignment with the entities they imagine to be involved in its production and circulation. We argue these inferences hinge on a function of human sign systems that has thus far been little studied in data visualization: socio-indexicality, whereby the formal features (rather than the content) of communication evoke social contexts, identities, and characteristics. Demonstrating the presence and significance of this socio-indexical function in visualization, this paper offers both a conceptual foundation and practical intervention for troubleshooting breakdowns in public data communication.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"mjmorgen@mit.edu","name":"Michelle Morgenstern"},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"amyraefoxphd@gmail.com","name":"Amy Fox"},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"gmj@mit.edu","name":"Graham Jones"},{"affiliation":"MIT","email":"arvindsatya@mit.edu","name":"Arvind Satyanarayan"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"mjmorgen@mit.edu","name":"Michelle Morgenstern"},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"amyraefoxphd@gmail.com","name":"Amy Fox"},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"gmj@mit.edu","name":"Graham Jones"},{"affiliation":"MIT","email":"arvindsatya@mit.edu","name":"Arvind Satyanarayan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"amyraefoxphd@gmail.com","name":"Amy Rae Fox"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"amyraefoxphd@gmail.com","name":"Amy Rae Fox"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6a8c1148-d065-4251-9183-2955b9445817","keywords":["Semiotics","Socio-indexicality","Attitudes","Reception","Engagement","Visualization Psychology","Public Data Communication"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ERC6P","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1005-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTAwNS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjYwLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjB9.ZOJB6EdhINgTraf8Z6pkEd-S-OyLkGaPZWIcyaJEFRU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1005-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=7da1e18074c17ccb3f478c9be7e382046b99a99ace0743a3a6d2990a7bbdf883","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1005-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=4ab2f8c0a2d2bc8dae4ea069d6fb9910aec1f6e4bd675d7f6bd0254ce3e506a9","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners involved in communicating scientific data to general publics would be interested in reading this paper.

However, the design of journalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance multiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience\u2019s expected data literacy, tight publication deadlines, and the team\u2019s technical skills. Data journalists often come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and data science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While previous studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process employed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific research questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do editorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we collected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news articles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result, we created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both properties describing the articles\u2019 aspects and the visual/interactive features of maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured interviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily. Through these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made by editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected the practitioners\u2019 feedback on our design space to externally validate it. With these results, we aim to provide researchers and journalists with empirical data to design and study journalistic maps.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"agsn@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Arlindo Gomes"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"emilly.brito@ufpe.br","name":"Emilly Brito"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"gusto@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Luiz Morais"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"nivan@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Nivan Ferreira"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"agsn@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Arlindo Gomes"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"emilly.brito@ufpe.br","name":"Emilly Brito"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"gusto@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Luiz Morais"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"nivan@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Nivan Ferreira"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"agsn@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Arlindo Gomes"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"agsn@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Arlindo Gomes"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6c986f26-eabe-4109-b6ab-7ba4c489451d","keywords":["design space","maps","news","visualization design","data visualization","data journalism"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/bhn6e/?view_only=6a130b6323364a1db514a3df45b94647","open_access_supplemental_question":"We provided our data collection in PDF format, a dataset that other authors can use to conduct new experiments and apply our data to different objectives, such as exploring data literacy or trust in data visualization.

In this paper, we present a new dataset and methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices and corresponding rationales of the students.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"maeve.hutchinson@city.ac.uk","name":"Maeve Hutchinson"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"radu.jianu@city.ac.uk","name":"Radu Jianu"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"j.d.wood@city.ac.uk","name":"Jo Wood"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"pranava.madhyastha@city.ac.uk","name":"Pranava Madhyastha"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"maeve.hutchinson@city.ac.uk","name":"Maeve Hutchinson"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"radu.jianu@city.ac.uk","name":"Radu Jianu"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"j.d.wood@city.ac.uk","name":"Jo Wood"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"pranava.madhyastha@city.ac.uk","name":"Pranava Madhyastha"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"maeve.hutchinson@city.ac.uk","name":"Maeve Hutchinson"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"maeve.hutchinson@city.ac.uk","name":"Maeve Hutchinson"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.388939+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6d474cda-8152-40b9-ba2f-7a28f9bbe0bd","keywords":["Design","Literate Visualization","Natural Language"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/maevehutch/DesignQAR; https://maevehutch.github.io/DesignQAR/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1218-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMTgtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY3fQ.OzkjXvqcADR99SjbEsGj51KYw8ae3kSln-3f1yD1hl8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1218-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=0d0f2a199e4188808ae220a11f7495584bc17cfd0048b8e414a9b54867e5ca95","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1218-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=7213ad37d3e88eeb401a87f959da37c32128baf55e6b3053c308796e554f8904","practitioners_statement":"This paper will be of interest to data visualization educators, data scientists, visual analytics researchers, UX designers, and HCI practitioners who engage in or support visualization design.

Yet, prior explorations of their visualization literacy have been limited to assessing their response correctness and fail to explore their internal reasoning. To address this gap, we adapted attention-guided class activation maps (AG-CAM) for VLMs to visualize the influence and importance of input features (image and text) on model responses.  Using this approach,  we conducted an examination of four open-source (ChartGemma, Janus 1B and 7B, and LLaVA) and two closed-source (GPT-4o, Gemini) models comparing their performance and, for the open-source models, their AG-CAM results. Overall, we found that ChartGemma, a 3B parameter VLM fine-tuned for chart question-answering (QA), outperformed other open-source models and exhibited performance on par with significantly larger closed-source VLMs. We also found that VLMs exhibit spatial reasoning by accurately localizing key chart features, and semantic reasoning by associating visual elements with corresponding data values and query tokens. Our approach is the first to demonstrate the use of AG-CAM on early fusion VLM architectures, which are widely used, and for chart QA. We also show preliminary evidence that these results can align with human reasoning. Our promising open-source VLMs results pave the way for transparent and reproducible research in AI visualization literacy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","email":"a7dong@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Lianghan Dong"},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","email":"a7dong@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Lianghan Dong"},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6f935187-a32b-477d-90a0-1a7e959c6222","keywords":["Vision Language Models","Visualization Literacy","Explainability","Chart Question and Answering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/fp3rg/","open_access_supplemental_question":"Novel methods, open source code, live demo","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1740-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc0MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.cc7gYgPLj5k-xArGkxlKK5g4imTZxOi6lW4WL9V-B5s","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1740-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=fc5870b2bbb08616ab6ddb8a526da85f6c6f4bb1e070ad32653d7c42e9271fc6","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1740-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=50da6c2b50a57f354b857829bdebdd81aeee06c2ee66b493280d38d77a36e39d","practitioners_statement":"Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, AI Engineers","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05445","program_paper_id":"1740","title":"Probing the Visualization Literacy of Vision Language Models: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Deep learning (DL) models have proven to be suitable for various applications, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Despite that, they experience notable performance drops when subjected to realistic transformations in input data. Analyzing model behavior under input transformations is essential to preemptively identify possible\nbreaking points and understand what image characteristics might cause them before their failure in the real world. We introduce SEG-RobustEye, a visual analytics (VA) design developed to assist in the evaluation of the robustness of segmentation models for endoscopy images under realistic input transformations. SEG-RobustEye is based on ProactiV [13], a VA framework designed for understanding the behaviour of image-to-image translation models. SEG-RobustEye is a tailored instance of the framework and an extension of ProactiV for medical images, in concrete endoscopic images. These require visual designs that enhance the relevant features for such medical applications, which are different from general natural scenes. SEG-RobustEye is designed to discover features that affect the model behaviour under specific transformations.\nSEG-RobustEye connects the provided perspectives by ProactiV, i.e., global and instance level, and extends to subgroup level patterns. Subgroup level patterns facilitate the discovery and generalizability of selected subgroups of instances. The value of our approach was verified against real-world cases in endoscopy imaging by DL developers as proof of concept of the potential of SEG-RobustEye and, by extension, of ProactiV.\n\n[13] V.

The CDS helps designers think critically and make informed improvements using heuristic evaluation. When developing a visual tool or pioneering a novel visualisation approach, identifying areas for enhancement can be challenging. Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation designers and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as studying visualisation in higher education. The CDS consists of three stages across six perspectives: Stage 1 captures the essence of the idea by assigning an indicative title and selecting five adjectives (from twenty options) to form initial impressions of the design. Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using 30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives---user, environment, interface, components, design, and visual marks. Stage 3 focuses on synthesising insights, reflecting on design decisions, and determining the next steps forward. We introduce the CDS and explore its use across three visualisation modules in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Our longstanding experience with the CDS has allowed us to refine and develop it over time: from its initial creation through workshops in 2017/18 to improvements in wording and the development of two applications by 2020, followed by the expansion of support notes and refinement of heuristics through 2023; while using it in our teaching each year. This sustained use allows us to reflect on its practical application and offer guidance on how others can incorporate it into their own work.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Bangor University","email":"j.c.roberts@bangor.ac.uk","name":"Jonathan C.

Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","email":"sunjianxin66@gmail.com","name":"Jianxin Sun"},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","email":"dlenz@anl.gov","name":"David Lenz"},{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","email":"hfyu@unl.edu","name":"Hongfeng Yu"},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","name":"Tom Peterka"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","email":"sunjianxin66@gmail.com","name":"Jianxin Sun"},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","email":"dlenz@anl.gov","name":"David Lenz"},{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","email":"hfyu@unl.edu","name":"Hongfeng Yu"},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","name":"Tom Peterka"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"sunjianxin66@gmail.com","name":"Jianxin Sun"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"sunjianxin66@gmail.com","name":"Jianxin Sun"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"72737da9-0932-41f6-99a2-803817cf8c15","keywords":["Time-varying volume","volume visualization","input encoding","deep learning"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1455-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQ1NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzUwLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNTB9.rqoQ6nd-0Bc9lkPXVIekY_JsKNxXzKyT0k9nuz70yYM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1455-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=99e7103edd00dd5dc0102a6bdb64ca0e9256f5561dbfd68f1b758bb531493226","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1455-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a98d9b8e0d7c190ec6567cbc1dfb4968b74b68b3f8231b8369a1e2b6e067b3f0","practitioners_statement":"Scientists in scientific simulation, data scientists, practitioners in data visualization.\n\nThe practitioners can apply the proposed method to reduce the training time of modeling large-scale, complex, and high-dimensional data into an implicit neural representation.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03836","program_paper_id":"1455","title":"F-Hash: Feature-Based Hash Design for Time-Varying Volume Visualization via Multi-Resolution Tesseract Encoding","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs\u2019 graphic perception behaviors.

We propose a visual abstraction method designed to provide better feature preservation across arbitrary abstraction levels for large-scale scatterplots, particularly in medium-to-low density regions. The method consists of three closely interconnected steps: first, we partition the scatterplot into iso-density regions and equalize visual density; then, we allocate pixels for different classes within each region; finally, we reconstruct the data distribution based on pixels. User studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach better preserves features and exhibits a special advantage when handling ultra-high dynamic range data distributions.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Lab","email":"sygzh6@tju.edu.cn","name":"Ziheng Guo"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"tianxiangwei@tju.edu.cn","name":"Tianxiang Wei"},{"affiliation":"Communication University of China","email":"lzyfun@cuc.edu.cn","name":"Zeyu Li"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"lianghaozhang@tju.edu.cn","name":"Lianghao Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"sisilee144144@gmail.com","name":"Sisi Li"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"jwzhang@tju.edu.cn","name":"Jiawan Zhang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Lab","email":"sygzh6@tju.edu.cn","name":"Ziheng Guo"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"tianxiangwei@tju.edu.cn","name":"Tianxiang Wei"},{"affiliation":"Communication University of China","email":"lzyfun@cuc.edu.cn","name":"Zeyu Li"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"lianghaozhang@tju.edu.cn","name":"Lianghao Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"sisilee144144@gmail.com","name":"Sisi Li"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"jwzhang@tju.edu.cn","name":"Jiawan Zhang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"sygzh6@tju.edu.cn","name":"Ziheng Guo"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"sygzh6@tju.edu.cn","name":"Ziheng Guo"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"76560e50-f8e7-446f-943e-2ba7ff188c86","keywords":["Scatterplot Abstraction","Overlap-free","Overdraw","Arbitrary Abstraction Level"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Guozihengwww/PixelatedScatter","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1593-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU5My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzZ9.mn7FFeeoD-8R7pDOHcZ1IoVvdwEl2CUGQMjDdPAw0UA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1593-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=b2d3d3b2df4d07489fd65a2f97f39cca2de94eaec2105ef438c8598ebf7c5c5c","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1593-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=04fef8bf559507b3aeb26d9f7dc6bfcf577f0c15eaa55c9c88a622d937ae34f5","practitioners_statement":"This paper is for practitioners like data scientists, ML engineers, and bioinformaticians who need to visualize massive datasets, such as those from dimensionality reduction.

Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"kai@nd.edu","name":"Kuangshi Ai"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"kai@nd.edu","name":"Kuangshi Ai"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.549263+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945532137705635","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"77c7ae29-07ac-4a7b-90d1-5ca6794c6632","keywords":["Novel view synthesis","style transfer","textured Gaussian splatting","vision-language model","volume visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1274-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTI3NC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MjY5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAyNjl9.MPeWD6fqi0A7ECzgMyCfvQfjGXIP6Jd365AutzMPC_Q","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1274-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=c87b32c3b9b6c841d28e882820f1ad36e3d8b7b34833d163d8544ee3d929d153","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1274-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=1527976097b0b783397c4f52cbf217904a3e3a171b1bbe813b1de094e3b41fef","practitioners_statement":"This work will appeal to practitioners interested in scene representation, Gaussian splatting, and vision-language model techniques, particularly those working in the fields of scientific visualization, computer graphics, and 3D vision.\n\nPractitioners can utilize TexGS-VolVis to perform real-time, expressive editing of volume visualization scenes, including style transfer via image or text prompts, as well as control over color, opacity, and lighting.

Our crowdsourced experiment revealed only minimal differences in decision outcomes between chart types, suggesting that perceptual affordances established in controlled analytical tasks may not directly translate to high-level decision scenarios.

To address this challenge, we designed Iguanodon, an easy-to-use game application that complements the traditional methods of improving visualization construction literacy. In our game application, users interactively choose whether to apply design choices, which we assign to sub-tasks that must be optimized to create an effective chart. The application offers multiple game variations to help users learn how different design choices should be applied to construct effective charts. Furthermore, our approach easily adapts to different visualization design guidelines. We describe the application's design and present the results of a user study with 37 participants.

However, existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for LLMs primarily rely on word-level explanations, which are often computationally inefficient and misaligned with human reasoning processes. Moreover, these methods often treat explanation as a one-time output, overlooking its inherently interactive and iterative nature. In this paper, we present LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization system that addresses these limitations by enabling intuitive and efficient exploration of LLM behaviors through counterfactual analysis. Our system features a novel algorithm that generates fluent and semantically meaningful counterfactuals via targeted removal and replacement operations at user-defined levels of granularity. These counterfactuals are used to compute feature attribution scores, which are then integrated with concrete examples in a table-based visualization, supporting dynamic analysis of model behavior. A user study with LLM practitioners and interviews with experts demonstrate the system\u2019s usability and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the explanation process as active participants rather than passive recipients.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"furui.cheng@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Furui Cheng"},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","email":"vzouhar@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Vil\u00e9m Zouhar"},{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"robin.chan@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Robin Chan"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"daniel.fuerst@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Daniel F\u00fcrst"},{"affiliation":"IBM Research AI","email":"hendrik@strobelt.com","name":"Hendrik Strobelt"},{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"melassady@ai.ethz.ch","name":"Mennatallah El-Assady"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"furui.cheng@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Furui Cheng"},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","email":"vzouhar@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Vil\u00e9m Zouhar"},{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"robin.chan@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Robin Chan"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"daniel.fuerst@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Daniel F\u00fcrst"},{"affiliation":"IBM Research AI","email":"hendrik@strobelt.com","name":"Hendrik Strobelt"},{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"melassady@ai.ethz.ch","name":"Mennatallah El-Assady"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"furui.cheng@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Furui Cheng"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"furui.cheng@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Furui Cheng"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"7a68a26e-4b20-444f-a76a-eee7a08ab3be","keywords":["Counterfactual","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Large Language Model","Visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"The paper contributes an interactive visualization system for analyzing large language model behaviors together with an algorithm for meaning textual counterfactual generation.","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1701-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTcwMS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.rf9LusEe57KY5mJV8uAa1_Azz-sQfLE2UhXKG3p4rgg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1701-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=f62916743d240c85a5648346dd783b568ffb121c83ec4eb6242d39aec961b339","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1701-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=13876486957598f68aa9993ac41b70af20f12bf7c08e7248ff8b98d4f039d0dc","practitioners_statement":"large language model (application) researchers and developers; \nresearchers in explainable AI and human-AI interaction","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00708","program_paper_id":"1701","title":"Understanding Large Language Model Behaviors through Interactive Counterfactual Generation and Analysis","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by blood entering the media layer of the aortic vessel wall. This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke-University","email":"aar.schr@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Schroeder"},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University","email":"kai.ostendorf@st.ovgu.de","name":"Kai Ostendorf"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"baeumler@stanford.edu","name":"Kathrin Baeumler"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"mastro@stanford.edu","name":"Domenico Mastrodicasa"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"d.fleischmann@stanford.edu","name":"Dominik Fleischmann"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"bernhard@isg.cs.uni-magdeburg.de","name":"Bernhard Preim"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"gmistelb@stanford.edu","name":"Gabriel Mistelbauer"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke-University","email":"aar.schr@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Schroeder"},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University","email":"kai.ostendorf@st.ovgu.de","name":"Kai Ostendorf"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"baeumler@stanford.edu","name":"Kathrin Baeumler"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"mastro@stanford.edu","name":"Domenico Mastrodicasa"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"d.fleischmann@stanford.edu","name":"Dominik Fleischmann"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"bernhard@isg.cs.uni-magdeburg.de","name":"Bernhard Preim"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"gmistelb@stanford.edu","name":"Gabriel Mistelbauer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"aar.schr@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Schroeder"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"aar.schr@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Schroeder"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"7b762da7-ec92-461b-ab0a-95e7e278234d","keywords":["Medical Visualization","Flow Visualization","Hemodynamics","Aortic Dissection."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/aaschr/vis_2025_smoke_surfaces_for_AD","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1426-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQyNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDJ9.n04tE_duG-TebUw9-7_nNJdM4hQRtLKEtBefAmCoRtg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1426-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=c83e266649f685878fe9db99e3efde437be9c4415d9e3a2c64e8478afb7c43af","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1426-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=ac29707da2525d7a8ab5fd0443e84cf915522e55e25b31f2b22ce288ef68d33d","practitioners_statement":"Radiologists and vascular surgeons could discover new possibilities for the visualization of the data that is already available to them and develop new diagnostic and treatment planning strategies.

An analysis of the feasibility of using AR in journal publications for 3D visualizations took place two years ago, in 2023, when Adams et al. evaluated whether the perceived workload between AR and non-AR technologies was comparable. Given that the use of AR for astronomy journal publications was, and still is, in its infancy, the original study had to utilize data intended for K-12 education that had similar interactions and data types as a proxy for real-world data that could be visualized in future astronomy publications. In this paper, we present the results of a conceptual replication study of Adams et al.\u2019s work to validate whether their findings hold with real astronomy stimuli. We found in our replication that many of the trends in the original study hold true, but that the workload experienced by participants was significantly higher under multiple conditions when using real-world data. Additionally, we found that the tradeoff between engagement and workload was as prevalent in the replication as it was in the original study. Our results provide a new framing for researchers to understand the tradeoffs of immersive visualization technologies and the increased workload of pairing these tools with complex, scientific stimuli.

Our work is inspired by the growing number of empirical studies in visualization research that rely on visualization literacy as a basis for developing effective data representations or educational interventions. Researchers have already made various efforts to assess this construct, yet it is often hard to pinpoint either what we want to measure or what we are effectively measuring. In this autoethnography, we gather insights from 14 internal interviews with researchers who are users or designers of visualization literacy tests. We aim to identify what makes visualization literacy assessment a wicked problem. We further reflect on the fluidity of visualization literacy and discuss how this property may lead to misalignment between what the construct is and how measurements of it are used or designed. We also examine potential threats to measurement validity from conceptual, operational, and methodological perspectives. Based on our experiences and reflections, we propose several calls to action aimed at tackling the wicked problem of visualization literacy measurement, such as by broadening test scopes and modalities, improving test ecological validity, making it easier to use tests, seeking interdisciplinary collaboration, and drawing from continued dialogue on visualization literacy to expect and be more comfortable with its fluidity.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"wanqian.ge@northwestern.edu","name":"Lily W.

Previous works approach this problem from topic- and entity-based perspectives, but the capability of the underlying NLP model limits their effectiveness. Recent advances in prompting with LLMs present opportunities to enhance such approaches with higher accuracy and customizability. However, poorly designed prompts and visualizations could mislead users into falsely interpreting the visualizations and hinder the system's trustworthiness. In this paper, we address this issue by taking into account the user analysis tasks and visualization goals in the prompt-based data extraction stage, thereby extending the concept of Model Alignment. We present HINTs, a VA system for supporting sensemaking on large collections of documents, combining previous entity-based and topic-based approaches. The visualization pipeline of HINTs consists of three stages. First, entities and topics are extracted from the corpus with prompts. Then, the result is modeled as a hypergraph and hierarchically clustered. Finally, an enhanced space-filling curve layout is applied to visualize the hypergraph for interactive exploration. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate the sensemaking of interested documents. To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study. We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking. We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are still necessary. We discuss limitations and future work for combining interactive visualization and LLMs more profoundly to better support corpus analysis.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"},{"email":null,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"},{"email":null,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ytlee@ucdavis.edu","name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ytlee@ucdavis.edu","name":"Sam Yu-Te Lee"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.274048+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3459961","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"7eeae5e6-01ae-4570-90f6-069956401413","keywords":["Data visualization","Data mining","Intelligent agents","Visual analytics","Tag clouds","Pipelines","Fake news"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Visualization researchers, HCI researchers interested in LLMs, Agent System develoeprs.

Focusing on bar charts, we incorporate cognitive insights into visualization design to better align with how humans perceive OMVs. Studies in cognitive psychology suggest that, for large numerical ranges such as millions and billions, people do not think logarithmically. Instead, they perceive numbers in a piecewise linear manner, grouping values into scale words (e.g., millions) and applying linear reasoning within each group. We build upon a recently introduced piecewise linear scale, EplusM, and validate its use in bar charts, which we refer to as EplusM bar charts. We also introduce two novel variants of the EplusM bar chart informed by findings in numerical perception: Bricks, which builds on the concepts of round numbers and subitizing, and Multi-Magnitude, which leverages categorical perception of large numbers. In a crowdsourced experiment, we evaluate four bar chart designs: 1) Log, 2) EplusM, 3) Bricks, and 4) Multi-Magnitude, across value retrieval and quantitative comparison tasks. Our results show that EplusM bar charts are significantly preferred over logarithmic designs, increase user confidence, and reduce perceived mental demand, while maintaining task performance. These findings suggest that EplusM bar charts can serve as effective alternatives to logarithmic ones when visualizing OMVs for general audiences.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Berger-Levrault","email":"kbatziakoudi@gmail.com","name":"Katerina Batziakoudi"},{"affiliation":"Berger-Levrault","email":"reystef@gmail.com","name":"St\u00e9phanie Rey"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN","email":"jean-daniel.fekete@inria.fr","name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Berger-Levrault","email":"kbatziakoudi@gmail.com","name":"Katerina Batziakoudi"},{"affiliation":"Berger-Levrault","email":"reystef@gmail.com","name":"St\u00e9phanie Rey"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN","email":"jean-daniel.fekete@inria.fr","name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kbatziakoudi@gmail.com","name":"Katerina Batziakoudi"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"kbatziakoudi@gmail.com","name":"Katerina Batziakoudi"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"80f2d2e8-877c-469a-8ce2-bb3e5bea1f93","keywords":["orders of magnitude","comparisons","exponent","mantissa","logarithmic scale","bar charts"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/ hybvp/?view_only=5cd17943e9ba46deb66a8f7f4eeeb4da","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1497-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQ5Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDN9._boubZw1aZ23gLJdfzE6ZM7nM9JnzzkE_AFA090VsJM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1497-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=22a8c71c8813a7f6098f810b16a1992451e4e7d345e9b30175bff86452c9a13e","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1497-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=15b27cdf1d1ab139bdcefe3b315c4d6ec3bfa19068ef25ebaf39780a7490b74c","practitioners_statement":"This paper would be valuable to any practitioner who needs to visualize quantitative data spanning multiple orders of magnitude for general audiences\u2014a common challenge in domains such as finance, healthcare, public policy, environmental science, and science communication.

Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"dan3@nd.edu","name":"Delin An"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"pdu@nd.edu","name":"Pan Du"},{"affiliation":"Cornell University","email":"jw2837@cornell.edu","name":"Jian-Xun Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"dan3@nd.edu","name":"Delin An"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"pdu@nd.edu","name":"Pan Du"},{"affiliation":"Cornell University","email":"jw2837@cornell.edu","name":"Jian-Xun Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"dan3@nd.edu","name":"Delin An"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"dan3@nd.edu","name":"Delin An"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945503985664072","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"8330bc4e-c9eb-41e0-8fa0-8043f0518241","keywords":["Conditional diffusion model","volume-guided surface generation","multi-branch vessel modeling"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1206-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTIwNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MjQ4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAyNDh9.XeRxA-Gh5GMy__KJKKe2QfJUGSNxvEnDimt8z7Cb3Ho","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1206-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=97fd8a49c311c441d2981ccaa80cb986c1224c9d22ed336413b154dcd94ddb11","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1206-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=066e3fc9b6f8d65d942f3324886573b4e957bf1f4f76d90286cddbb37bc7ac78","practitioners_statement":"Researchers whose work focuses on medical image processing, computational fluid dynamics simulation, and aortic visualization will find this paper of interest.

Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing  time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","email":"ychan@adobe.com","name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan"},{"affiliation":"University of Sao Paulo","email":"gnonato@icmc.usp.br","name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"},{"affiliation":"Paris Descartes University","email":"themis@mi.parisdescartes.fr","name":"Themis Palpanas"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"csilva@nyu.edu","name":"Claudio Silva"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"juliana.freire@nyu.edu","name":"Juliana Freire"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","email":"ychan@adobe.com","name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan"},{"affiliation":"University of Sao Paulo","email":"gnonato@icmc.usp.br","name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"},{"affiliation":"Paris Descartes University","email":"themis@mi.parisdescartes.fr","name":"Themis Palpanas"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"csilva@nyu.edu","name":"Claudio Silva"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"juliana.freire@nyu.edu","name":"Juliana Freire"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ychan@adobe.com","name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ychan@adobe.com","name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945546931015811","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"8347663a-7e88-43e2-a557-e7b2179fd4e5","keywords":["Time Series Visualization","Sub-sequence Clustering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/GromitC/TiVy","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1930-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTkzMC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.d9tLs0WVdP18T-ttWzACmcbTh0Ew8xnYrbI2Mvxw_hU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1930-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=64f089331dee262ea4dad601e27b56342c80168f94d84abfcafae5762568cb76","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1930-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=7fa80ef802f6ee324fcf9431b800f8a7a6afb932c937ef5ae01267b5e26a05db","practitioners_statement":"time series researchers,\nneuroscientist,\ndata scientist","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18972","program_paper_id":"1930","title":"TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Data-driven decision making has become a popular practice in science, industry, and public policy.

Analysts are often not only familiar with the data itself, but also have data hunches about their analysis subject. In this work, we present an interview study with analysts from a wide range of domains and with varied expertise and experience, inquiring about the role of contextual knowledge. We provide insights into how data is insufficient in analysts' workflows and how they incorporate other sources of knowledge into their analysis. We analyzed how knowledge of data shaped their analysis outcome.

A tensor field assigns a tensor\u2014a multi-dimensional array of numbers \u2014 to each point in space. Tensor fields, such as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are essential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields captures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such as graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for analyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may distort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and visualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are preserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate points essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains eigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric tensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of each cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific data compressors SZ3 and SPERR.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"u1472279@utah.edu","name":"Nathaniel Gorski"},{"affiliation":"University of Kentucky","email":"xliang@uky.edu","name":"Xin Liang"},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","name":"Bei Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"u1472279@utah.edu","name":"Nathaniel Gorski"},{"affiliation":"University of Kentucky","email":"xliang@uky.edu","name":"Xin Liang"},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","name":"Bei Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"u1472279@utah.edu","name":"Nathaniel Gorski"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"u1472279@utah.edu","name":"Nathaniel Gorski"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"84ab0ade-9529-4942-b5e1-ca953e56c880","keywords":["Lossy compression","tensor fields","topology preservation","topological data analysis","topology in visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1929-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTkyOS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTQ2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5NDZ9.fYJBfbEGEc5BiszOmrZH_2VraKk6dKNk-SSHcT10Xcs","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1929-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=5552f2c796e499b33746c0f5fe1376a27e0e0f07c465591089616f5ae61c6cde","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1929-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=bd0e737abd3fd2fe5b665458ae8267a086efc97109ed1249bbe9f6fa510718e5","practitioners_statement":"The main practitioners of interest would be anybody who works with large amounts of tensor field data and employs topological applications.

While visual prompt engineering has advanced in text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement. Extensive testing and a user study demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"51275902056@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Nan Xiang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"51215901019@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Tianyi Liang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"hwhuang@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Haiwen Huang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"52265901032@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Shiqi Jiang"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"2690210766@qq.com","name":"Hao Huang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"yifeihuang17@gmail.com","name":"Yifei Huang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"lychen@sei.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Liangyu Chen"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"cbwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Changbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"chli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Chenhui Li"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"51275902056@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Nan Xiang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"51215901019@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Tianyi Liang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"hwhuang@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Haiwen Huang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"52265901032@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Shiqi Jiang"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"2690210766@qq.com","name":"Hao Huang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"yifeihuang17@gmail.com","name":"Yifei Huang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"lychen@sei.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Liangyu Chen"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"cbwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Changbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"chli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Chenhui Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"51275902056@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Nan Xiang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"51275902056@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Nan Xiang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"84ef8d69-bdba-43e8-a078-ae651a3de164","keywords":["Prompt engineering","text-to-3D generation","shape exploration","visualization design","visual perception"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1770-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc3MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.hiyLTH_krbi6CjMLdDCd0Tjp5_ux1TVwp1RhWZMYUBY","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1770-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a0aea867baef3038b54fa65aac27b24195c539113915635f1e0b97895b77971a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1770-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=2a3641eabffb7af390161ef3819ba844892d120e001e39640d76d63e614f70a3","practitioners_statement":"This work primarily targets practitioners in 3D content creation, including digital artists, industrial designers, and CAD software developers.

This study investigates how four learning materials \u2013 textbook, comic, video, and game \u2013 affect middle- and high school students\u2019 ability to interpret line charts, area charts, stacked area charts, and stream graphs. We conducted a comparative classroom study with 68 students, using pre- and post-tests, worksheet activities, and group discussions to assess learning outcomes and understanding. Our results show statistically significant improvement in students\u2019 understanding of stacked area charts and streamgraphs, while no significant differences between the learning materials were found. This suggests that more factors than initially anticipated \u2013 such as engagement, motivation and active learning strategies \u2013 influence the learning outcome. The analysis of the worksheets revealed that while students could infer surface-level insights from charts, over 70% struggled to identify underlying patterns or relationships. Additionally, a common challenge across all learning materials was reading fatigue, which often led students to skim content, disengage, or misinterpret key information. These findings highlight the need for educational tools and approaches that foster deeper understanding of unfamiliar visualizations, reduce cognitive load, and encourage active engagement.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"St. P\u00f6lten University of Applied Sciences","email":"magdalena.boucher@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Magdalena Boucher"},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","email":"makej@mail.muni.cz","name":"Magdalena Kejstova"},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","email":"christina.stoiber@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Christina Stoiber"},{"affiliation":"Austrian Computer Society","email":"martin.kandlhofer@ocg.at","name":"Martin Kandlhofer"},{"affiliation":"Austrian Computer Society","email":"leniproduction@gmail.com","name":"Alena Boucher"},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","email":"simone.kriglstein@univie.ac.at","name":"Simone Kriglstein"},{"affiliation":"Erich Fried Realgymnasium","email":"shelley.buchinger@brg9.at","name":"Shelley Buchinger"},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","email":"wolfgang.aigner@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Wolfgang Aigner"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"St. P\u00f6lten University of Applied Sciences","email":"magdalena.boucher@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Magdalena Boucher"},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","email":"makej@mail.muni.cz","name":"Magdalena Kejstova"},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","email":"christina.stoiber@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Christina Stoiber"},{"affiliation":"Austrian Computer Society","email":"martin.kandlhofer@ocg.at","name":"Martin Kandlhofer"},{"affiliation":"Austrian Computer Society","email":"leniproduction@gmail.com","name":"Alena Boucher"},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","email":"simone.kriglstein@univie.ac.at","name":"Simone Kriglstein"},{"affiliation":"Erich Fried Realgymnasium","email":"shelley.buchinger@brg9.at","name":"Shelley Buchinger"},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","email":"wolfgang.aigner@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Wolfgang Aigner"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"magdalena.boucher@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Magdalena Boucher"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"magdalena.boucher@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Magdalena Boucher"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"851f1b42-91da-4dcc-a08e-c6d8e564d251","keywords":["visualization education","schools","learning materials","visualization literacy"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://phaidra.fhstp.ac.at/detail/o:7304","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1863-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTg2My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.LE5fAigXM1klY3wa3np7PG18Pbf1sPWARgNIUeVhadQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1863-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a2d0693c560289747b782fd5cdd317323ff3e033a970b0882c5919e59e9f7f37","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1863-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=2ff5beeeaac7205e3ed60585bcb0c01566d63af44edc251deef002d71e006087","practitioners_statement":"Our findings are relevant for visualization educators and designers of learning materials  as they shed light on visualization literacy and student preferences in middle- and high schools.","preprint_link":"https://phaidra.fhstp.ac.at/detail/o:7302","program_paper_id":"1863","title":"Enhancing Data Visualization Literacy: A Comparative Study of Learning Materials in Schools","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"When analyzing heterogeneous data comprising numerical and categorical attributes, it is common to treat the different data types separately or transform the categorical attributes to numerical ones.

The disagreement problem is one such issue, as there may be scenarios where the output of different explanation methods disagree with each other. Although understanding how often, when, and where explanation methods agree or disagree is important to increase confidence in the explanations, few works have been dedicated to investigating such a problem. In this work, we proposed Visagreement, a visualization tool designed to assist practitioners in investigating the disagreement problem. Visagreement builds upon metrics to quantitatively compare and evaluate explanations, enabling visual resources to uncover where and why methods mostly agree or disagree. The tool is tailored for tabular data with binary classification and focuses on local feature importance methods. In the provided use cases, Visagreement turned out to be effective in revealing, among other phenomena, how disagreements relate to the quality of the explanations and machine learning model accuracy, thus assisting users in deciding where and when to trust explanations. To assess the effectiveness and practical utility of Visagreement, we conducted an evaluation involving four experts. These experts assessed the tool's Effectiveness, Usability, and Impact on Decision-Making. The experts confirm the Visagreement tool's effectiveness and user-friendliness, making it a valuable asset for analyzing and exploring (dis)agreements.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Priscylla Silva"},{"email":null,"name":"Vitoria Guardieiro"},{"email":null,"name":"Brian Barr"},{"email":null,"name":"Claudio Silva"},{"email":null,"name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Priscylla Silva"},{"email":null,"name":"Vitoria Guardieiro"},{"email":null,"name":"Brian Barr"},{"email":null,"name":"Claudio Silva"},{"email":null,"name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"priscylla.silva@usp.br","name":"Priscylla Silva"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"priscylla.silva@usp.br","name":"Priscylla Silva"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.84764+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3558074","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"86b81feb-984c-4b76-bda1-202a9c48c25c","keywords":["Measurement","Machine learning","Data visualization","Accuracy","Extraterrestrial measurements","Analytical models","Data models","Visual analytics","Training","Space exploration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"This paper would interest data scientists, AI/ML researchers, visualization experts, and practitioners in regulated fields (finance, healthcare, criminal justice) who rely on explainable AI (XAI) to interpret model decisions.

To address these challenges, we introduce AttributionScanner, an innovative human-in-the-loop Visual Analytics (VA) system, designed for metadata-free data slice finding. Our system identifies interpretable data slices that involve common model behaviors and visualizes these patterns through an Attribution Mosaic design. Our interactive interface provides straightforward guidance for users to detect, interpret, and annotate predominant model issues, such as spurious correlations (model biases) and mislabeled data, with minimal effort. Additionally, it employs a cutting-edge model regularization technique to mitigate the detected issues and enhance the model\u2019s performance. The efficacy of AttributionScanner is demonstrated through use cases involving two benchmark datasets, with qualitative and quantitative evaluations showcasing its substantial effectiveness in vision model validation, ultimately leading to more reliable and accurate models.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Xiwei Xuan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jorge Piazentin Ono"},{"email":null,"name":"Liang Gou"},{"email":null,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"},{"email":null,"name":"Liu Ren"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Xiwei Xuan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jorge Piazentin Ono"},{"email":null,"name":"Liang Gou"},{"email":null,"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"},{"email":null,"name":"Liu Ren"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jorge.piazentinono@us.bosch.com","name":"Jorge Ono"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jorge.piazentinono@us.bosch.com","name":"Jorge Ono"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.370804+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3546644","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"87a90010-17cf-4a03-a81f-38b56bb28d64","keywords":["Computational modeling","Analytical models","Data visualization","Correlation","Accuracy","Visual analytics","Annotations","Image color analysis","Vectors","Training"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data Scientists, AI Developers, ML Engineers, AI Release Engineers, AI Compliance and Validation Specialists","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06462v1","program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2024-05-0337]","title":"AttributionScanner: A Visual Analytics System for Model Validation with Metadata-Free Slice Finding","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Visual Analytics (VA) researchers frequently collaborate closely with domain experts to derive requirements and select appropriate solutions to fulfill these requirements. Despite strides made in exploring requirement and solution spaces, challenges persist due to the absence of guidance in the initial consideration space and the lack of shared problem-solving knowledge, often resulting in suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, we conducted an empirical study of VA research, with a focus on mapping the relations between requirement and solution spaces. Analyzing 220 VA papers, we formulate refined topologies for data, requirements, and solutions. We propose conceptualizing the connections between requirements, data, and solutions through knowledge graphs and utilizing solution paths to encapsulate fundamental problem-solving knowledge in visual analytics research. Through the integration of solution paths into a graph and analyzing their interconnections, we identified a subset of problem-driven design patterns that demonstrated the efficacy of our approach.

This work introduces ParaView-MCP, an autonomous agent that integrates modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with ParaView to not only lower the barrier to entry but also augment ParaView with intelligent decision support. By leveraging the state-of-the-art reasoning, command execution, and vision capabilities of MLLMs, ParaView-MCP enables users to interact with ParaView through natural language and visual inputs. Specifically, our system adopted the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized interface for model-application communication, which facilitates direct interaction between MLLMs and ParaView's Python API, allowing seamless information exchange between the user, the language model, and the visualization tool itself. Furthermore, by implementing a visual feedback mechanism that allows the agent to observe the viewport, we unlock a range of new capabilities, including recreating visualizations from examples, closed-loop visualization parameter updates based on user-defined goals, and even cross-application collaboration involving multiple tools.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"shusen.liu.hust@gmail.com","name":"Shusen Liu"},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"miao1@llnl.gov","name":"Haichao Miao"},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"bremer5@llnl.gov","name":"Peer-Timo Bremer"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"shusen.liu.hust@gmail.com","name":"Shusen Liu"},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"miao1@llnl.gov","name":"Haichao Miao"},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"bremer5@llnl.gov","name":"Peer-Timo Bremer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"shusen.liu.hust@gmail.com","name":"Shusen Liu"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"shusen.liu.hust@gmail.com","name":"Shusen Liu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:16.839835+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"881a464d-c01d-453c-8f14-8b59acdde104","keywords":["Agent","Tool Use","Model Context Protocol"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/LLNL/paraview_mcp","open_access_supplemental_question":"Well documented source code","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1100-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMDAtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM4fQ.YibVKkYT_n4KY0LL-mvnB6_KSUZ0vnb290OeagWz5Kc","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1100-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=f0af2a18526aa8f31edd0ed085fac7e7ba4722b791400aa38031ba72b1a2ae2c","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1100-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=5be08d8c3d8eac67c894b90795d40dc0e0086b23f3de722e2f3eb6c1932bfc7a","practitioners_statement":"domain scientists / user who want to use paraview to generate visualization but never have time to learn it.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07064","program_paper_id":"1100","title":"Paraview-MCP: An Autonomous Visualization Agent with Direct Tool Use","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source code, interactive features, and metadata.

To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images.

We propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for crop localization.

However, existing INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3) dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on scientific data encoding tasks.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"ehsson@korea.ac.kr","name":"Hyunsoo Son"},{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"wjdgus0967@korea.ac.kr","name":"Jeonghyun Noh"},{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"orangeblush@korea.ac.kr","name":"Suemin Jeon"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"},{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"wkjeong@korea.ac.kr","name":"Won-Ki Jeong"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"ehsson@korea.ac.kr","name":"Hyunsoo Son"},{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"wjdgus0967@korea.ac.kr","name":"Jeonghyun Noh"},{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"orangeblush@korea.ac.kr","name":"Suemin Jeon"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"},{"affiliation":"Korea University","email":"wkjeong@korea.ac.kr","name":"Won-Ki Jeong"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ehsson@korea.ac.kr","name":"Hyunsoo Son"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ehsson@korea.ac.kr","name":"Hyunsoo Son"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.714397+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"894782c9-d5b8-4e59-959b-5f71ea2ff688","keywords":["Implicit neural representation","meta-learning","clustering","multivariate data encoding"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"superior performance on the unstructured grids datasets","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1115-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMTUtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM4fQ.GdVrvXJ7Eqdqg1_e4iP_N9s6mx2_h7Ok6fKlmslI9AU","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1115-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=4f5632009f1027f30aa1afbc6816ba7606cb0d93098189109de2924d4dc8e9e1","practitioners_statement":"simulation scientists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1115","title":"MC-INR: Efficient Encoding of Multivariate Scientific Simulation Data  using Meta-Learning and Clustered Implicit Neural Representations","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Hagrid is a state-of-the-art space-filling-curve-based method for gridifying scatterplots. However, it exhibits limitations in preserving the global structures of scatterplots with areas of varying density due to the incompatibility of adapting the granularity level of the underlying space-filling curve to regions with different densities. To compensate for this shortcoming, we introduce SiGrid that combines Hagrid with the Sector-Based Regularization (SBR) technique. SiGrid applies SBR to generate a scatterplot with a more uniform and generally lower density as an intermediate step. This intermediate scatterplot can then be fed to Hagrid for improved results. We quantitatively evaluate SiGrid by comparing it to Hagrid over a set of 502 scatterplots of different sizes, ranging from 50 to 10000 points per dataset, using relevant quality metrics. While generally slower, the results demonstrate that SiGrid outperforms Hagrid regarding the quality metrics of rank-wise neighborhood preservation (trustworthiness), ordering preservation, and pairwise distance preservation (cross-correlation).","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"rene.cutura@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Rene Cutura"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"hennes.rave@uni-muenster.de","name":"Hennes Rave"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"quynh.ngo@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Quynh Ngo"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"molchano@uni-muenster.de","name":"Vladimir Molchanov"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"linsen@uni-muenster.de","name":"Lars Linsen"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Daniel Weiskopf"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"michael.sedlmair@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Michael Sedlmair"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"rene.cutura@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Rene Cutura"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"hennes.rave@uni-muenster.de","name":"Hennes Rave"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"quynh.ngo@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Quynh Ngo"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"molchano@uni-muenster.de","name":"Vladimir Molchanov"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"linsen@uni-muenster.de","name":"Lars Linsen"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"weiskopf@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Daniel Weiskopf"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"michael.sedlmair@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Michael Sedlmair"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"rene.cutura@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Rene Cutura"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"rene.cutura@visus.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Rene Cutura"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.501591+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"89bf8d86-33c7-4bf0-b790-98bf9272ee2e","keywords":["Scatterplot","Space-filling curve","Grid layout","Neighborhood preservation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1261-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyNjEtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU3NywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTc3fQ.IQiQXWywbtp-OrvfnAnCXn-kn6sRg7wdMRu469m6Zk0","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1261-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=4e391cf908a8f37a0e17d0ab720b3be7930126cfa06fd68e4bd840a9ea0be432","practitioners_statement":"People creating visualizations using glyphs or images in scatterplots.","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1261","title":"SiGrid: Gridifying Scatterplots with Sector-Based Regularization and Hagrid","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in data visualization knowledge tasks.

However, these datasets are often large, making it challenging for interactive visualization systems to deliver a seamless user experience because of high input latency that arises from I/O bottlenecks and limited fast memory resources with high miss rates. To address this issue, we have proposed a deep learning-based prefetching method called RmdnCache, which optimizes the data flow across the memory hierarchy to reduce the input latency of large-scale volume visualization. Our approach accurately prefetches the content of the next view to fast memory using learning-based prediction while rendering the current view.

In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology\u2014people\u2019s ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting\u2014in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots\u2014between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices\u2014across three different tasks\u2014class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments\u2014to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Oklahoma","email":"quadri@ou.edu","name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri"},{"affiliation":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"gisellez@ad.unc.edu","name":"Mengyuan Zhu"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"chint@cs.unc.edu","name":"Chin Tseng"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","name":"Danielle Szafir"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Oklahoma","email":"quadri@ou.edu","name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri"},{"affiliation":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"gisellez@ad.unc.edu","name":"Mengyuan Zhu"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"chint@cs.unc.edu","name":"Chin Tseng"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","name":"Danielle Szafir"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"8aa31c36-374d-4155-b9c3-fd20d8deeec2","keywords":["Visualization Perception","Psychology","Subitizing","Fechner\u2019s Law","Dual-System Theory","Categorical Data","Color","Shape"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/y3z2b/?view_only=7f6569187b344fadbd11cc09a6e63d24","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1566-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU2Ni1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.GKAvgeJVw-gUBxJ1l3xCFigzU-0UTuswvm4WeQXv58k","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1566-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=44f139ae5e174fb63110d8f746e8be590e5ea1d8e14929f69ea8dc77cc91d7af","practitioners_statement":"Designer, Visualization Psychologist, Empirical Researcher","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1566","title":"Characterizing Visualization Perception with Psychological Phenomena: Uncovering the Role of Subitizing in Data Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Feature level sets (FLS) have shown significant potential in the analysis of multi-field data by using traits defined in attribute space to specify features in the domain. In this work, we address key challenges in the practical use of FLS: trait design and feature selection for rendering. To simplify trait design, we propose a Cartesian decomposition of traits into simpler components, making the process more intuitive and computationally efficient. Additionally, we utilize dictionary learning results to automatically suggest point traits. To enhance feature selection, we introduce trait-induced merge trees (TIMTs), a generalization of merge trees for feature level sets, aimed at topologically analyzing tensor fields or general multi-variate data. The leaves in the TIMT represent areas in the input data that are closest to the defined trait, thereby most closely resembling the defined feature. This merge tree provides a hierarchy of features, enabling the querying of the most relevant and persistent features. Our method includes various query techniques for the tree, allowing the highlighting of different aspects. We demonstrate the cross-application capabilities of this approach through five case studies from different domains.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Danhua Lei"},{"email":null,"name":"Jochen Jankowai"},{"email":null,"name":"Petar Hristov"},{"email":null,"name":"Hamish Carr"},{"email":null,"name":"Leif Denby"},{"email":null,"name":"Talha Bin Masood"},{"email":null,"name":"Ingrid Hotz"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Danhua Lei"},{"email":null,"name":"Jochen Jankowai"},{"email":null,"name":"Petar Hristov"},{"email":null,"name":"Hamish Carr"},{"email":null,"name":"Leif Denby"},{"email":null,"name":"Talha Bin Masood"},{"email":null,"name":"Ingrid Hotz"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"danhua.lei@liu.se","name":"Danhua Lei"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"danhua.lei@liu.se","name":"Danhua Lei"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.54128+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/tvcg.2025.3525974","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"8ac3fc70-e73e-4ea1-8eb2-0ce94992c6bc","keywords":["Level set","Rendering (computer graphics)","Feature extraction","Vegetation","Isosurfaces","Optical fiber testing","Geometry","Vectors","Transfer functions","Surface treatment"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data scientists, simulation scientists, people who work with multi-variant / multi-dimensional data.

At the same time, designing an effective VA solution is not a simple task, requiring its adaptation to the problem at hand and the intended user of the system. In this scenario, the User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology provides the framework to incorporate user needs into the design of a VA solution. On the other hand, its implementation mainly relies on qualitative feedback, with the designer missing tools supporting her in quantitatively reporting the user feedback and using it to hypothesize and test the successive changes to the VA solution. To overcome this limitation, we propose TraVIS, a Visual Analytics solution allowing the loading of a web-based VA system, collecting user traces, and analyzing them with respect to the system at hand. In this process, the designer can leverage the collected traces and relate them to the tasks the VA solution supports and how those can be achieved. Using TraVIS, the designer can identify ineffective interaction paths, analyze the user traces support to task completion, hypothesize corrections to the design, and evaluate the effect of changes. We evaluated TraVIS through experimentation with 11 VA systems from literature, a use case, and user evaluation with five experts. Results show the benefits that TraVIS provides in terms of identifying design problems and efficient support for UCD.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Matteo Filosa"},{"email":null,"name":"Alexandra Plexousaki"},{"email":null,"name":"Matteo Di Stadio"},{"email":null,"name":"Francesco Bovi"},{"email":null,"name":"Dario Benvenuti"},{"email":null,"name":"Tiziana Catarci"},{"email":null,"name":"Marco Angelini"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Matteo Filosa"},{"email":null,"name":"Alexandra Plexousaki"},{"email":null,"name":"Matteo Di Stadio"},{"email":null,"name":"Francesco Bovi"},{"email":null,"name":"Dario Benvenuti"},{"email":null,"name":"Tiziana Catarci"},{"email":null,"name":"Marco Angelini"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"angelini@diag.uniroma1.it","name":"Marco Angelini"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"angelini@diag.uniroma1.it","name":"Marco Angelini"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.695102+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3546863","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"8d730321-05df-42cd-bb4d-013ae3589399","keywords":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","User centered design","Optimization","Taxonomy","Process mining","Iterative methods","Hands","Focusing","Training"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Visualization and Visual Analytics System Designers, UX and Usability designers, HCI practitioners.

Through an analysis of 120 real-world visualizations and 804 text elements, we identified ten distinct text functions, ranging from identifying data mappings to presenting valenced subtext. We further identify patterns in text usage and conduct a factor analysis, revealing four overarching text-informed design strategies: Attribution and Variables, Annotation-Centric Design, Visual Embellishments, and Narrative Framing. In addition to these factors, we explore features of title rhetoric and text multifunctionality, while also uncovering previously unexamined text functions, such as text replacing visual elements. Our findings highlight the flexibility of text, demonstrating how different text elements in a given design can combine to communicate, synthesize, and frame visual information.

These factors may interact in unexpected ways, potentially compromising data readability during real-world use. Through a controlled experiment (N=32) comparing bar vs. radial visualizations across dial shapes and motion states, we found: (1) walking significantly reduces estimation accuracy, (2) bar charts consistently outperform radial variants by better supporting linear perception, and (3) radial bar graphs on square dials create particularly poor affordances than other combination. Our work provides the empirical evidence for how smartwatch dial factors, usage contexts and visualization design jointly impact data interpretation, offering concrete design guidelines for smartwatch visualization.

This paper presents a design study of CLOVE, a C science visual analytics application that encodes model dimensions in an intuitive way by using visual metaphors that correspond to the natural world.

While existing visualization design models have provided valuable structure and guidance, they tend to foreground technical problem-solving and underemphasize the interpretive, judgment-based aspects of design. In contrast, research in other design disciplines has emphasized the importance of framing---how designers define and redefine what the problem is---and the co-evolution of problem and solution spaces through reflective practice. These dimensions remain underexplored in visualization research, particularly from the perspective of expert practitioners. This paper investigates how visualization designers frame problems and navigate the interplay between problem understanding and solution development. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 11 expert design practitioners using design challenges, diary entries, and semi-structured interviews. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified key strategies that participants used to frame design problems, reframe them in response to evolving constraints or insights, and construct bridges between problem and solution spaces. These included the use of metaphors, heuristics, sketching, primary generators, and reflective evaluation of failed or incomplete ideas. Our findings contribute an empirically grounded account of visualization design as a reflective, co-evolutionary practice. We show that framing is not a preliminary step, but a continuous activity embedded in the act of designing. Participants frequently shifted their understanding of the problem based on solution attempts, feedback from tools, and ethical or narrative concerns. These insights extend current visualization design models and highlight the need for frameworks that better account for framing and interpretive judgment. We conclude with implications for visualization research, education, and practice. In particular, we discuss how design education can better support framing and co-evolutionary thinking, and how visualization research can benefit from greater attention to the cognitive strategies and reflective processes that underpin expert design.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul Parsons"},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"shukla37@purdue.edu","name":"Prakash Chandra Shukla"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul Parsons"},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"shukla37@purdue.edu","name":"Prakash Chandra Shukla"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul C Parsons"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul C Parsons"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"930062ee-90b2-4c48-9896-626047d01771","keywords":["Data visualization design","data visualization practice","problem framing","problem-solution co-evolution","design cognition"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1971-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTk3MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.en6rzZX5epd4w4FgsAwBfkdenEToEPX6riXh1i6zpzU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1971-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=c6c6ed552c93137e1b10d357404b77181e98f91621e12556cbcd354098f0bfb9","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1971-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=102d11da2389a7045e6fc9528206c0ac19027eee7f9cd0d2e11e7ef0c5ed714b","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners such as professional data visualization designers, UX designers, data journalists, and design consultants would find this paper valuable.

We then design FinFlier, a two-stage innovative system leveraging a knowledge-grounding large language model to automate graphical overlays for financial visualizations. The text-data binding module enhances the connection between financial vocabulary and tabular data through advanced prompt engineering, and the graphics overlaying module generates effective overlays with narrative sequencing. We demonstrate the feasibility and expressiveness of FinFlier through a gallery of graphical overlays covering diverse financial narrative visualizations.

Though machine learning algorithms that produce interpretable models are available, many factors influence the selection for a particular application, and many tools exist for building understanding post-hoc. One way to develop insight is to probe through a concept humans use in making decisions -- an examination of alternate scenarios that might change the outcome called counterfactuals. In this short paper, we build on work using counterfactuals for comprehending machine learning models by proposing a technique wherein users explore counterfactuals as paths through a tree of possible data attribute changes. We extend the technique to groups of data points and consequently to groups of counterfactuals. We provide a prototype implementation and and evaluation with four users from different fields of expertise who were able to apply CFTree to their own domain data and discover interesting attribute relationships.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"DePaul University","email":"caroline.cao39@gmail.com","name":"Fang Cao"},{"affiliation":"DePaul University","email":"ebrown80@cdm.depaul.edu","name":"Eli Brown"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"DePaul University","email":"caroline.cao39@gmail.com","name":"Fang Cao"},{"affiliation":"DePaul University","email":"ebrown80@cdm.depaul.edu","name":"Eli Brown"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"caroline.cao39@gmail.com","name":"Fang Cao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"caroline.cao39@gmail.com","name":"Fang Cao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.063302+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"973882c9-093a-4edf-b7b0-9157aabaa93b","keywords":["counterfactuals","human-centered AI","interpretable machine learning","visual analytics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/j2wgx/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1355-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzNTUtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY1fQ.7PUuH30XXB7RwNpafoBEYUb91V1PqKOc_ojPr__5Ko0","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1355-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=028a1dcac1222de48a60bf93c1222a6cc8b7854c52907aa97211e0e5fa2c7b6e","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1355-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=5140d87a32ac7459eae84fd7ef1388b62f531744fd38ebec72e479dfa4fcb0ce","practitioners_statement":"data scientists, technical domain experts using machine learning. \nPractitioners could use this technology in tuning or understanding their models","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1355","title":"CFTree: Exploring Paths Through Counterfactuals","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"This application paper investigates the stability of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), as characterized by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). First, we contribute a database of 4544 electron densities associated to four isomers of water hexamers (the so-called Ring, Book, Cage and Prism), generated by distorting their equilibrium geometry under various structural perturbations, modeling the natural dynamic behavior of molecular systems. Second, we present a new stability measure, called bond occurrence rate, associating each bond path present at equilibrium with its rate of occurrence within the input ensemble. We also provide an algorithm, called BondMatcher, for its automatic computation, based on a tailored, geometry-aware partial isomorphism estimation between the extremum graphs of the considered electron densities. Our new stability measure allows for the automatic identification of densities lacking H-bond paths, enabling further visual inspections. Specifically, the topological analysis enabled by our framework corroborates experimental observations and provides refined geometrical criteria for characterizing the disappearance of H-bond paths.

Yet, we find that this progress does not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for interpreting charts. We introduce ENCQA, a novel benchmark informed by the visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. ENCQA provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"kushinm11@gmail.com","name":"Kushin Mukherjee"},{"affiliation":"Apple","email":"donghao@apple.com","name":"Donghao Ren"},{"affiliation":"Apple","email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliation":"Apple","email":"yassogba@gmail.com","name":"Yannick Assogba"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"kushinm11@gmail.com","name":"Kushin Mukherjee"},{"affiliation":"Apple","email":"donghao@apple.com","name":"Donghao Ren"},{"affiliation":"Apple","email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliation":"Apple","email":"yassogba@gmail.com","name":"Yannick Assogba"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yassogba@gmail.com","name":"Yannick Assogba"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yassogba@gmail.com","name":"Yannick Assogba"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9942014b-e0f8-4cae-9b2a-81167d226c7b","keywords":["Visual encodings","visualization understanding tasks","machine chart understanding","vision-language models","model benchmarking"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1590-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU5MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.B2TL8t_siKSuYoA7ZPAehmS5ckwI245UooQ5GUllfEg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1590-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=cae037bdf5f62240291343b46107c119b7397b49997c9c7a855eac09a8a758bb","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1590-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=b174c2dfafef65603ae4a748040c239e68b8316bb9f6e4756d7468894ae7f8e0","practitioners_statement":"Machine learning researchers interested in improving chart-understanding in vision-language models and data visualization practitioners interested in leveraging vision-language models for automatically deriving insights from charts and graphs in documents and the web.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04650v1","program_paper_id":"1590","title":"EncQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Visual Encodings for Charts","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"UC Davis","email":"david.bauer009@gmail.com","name":"David Bauer"},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","email":"qiwu@nvidia.com","name":"Qi Wu"},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen","email":"h.gadirov@rug.nl","name":"Hamid Gadirov"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"UC Davis","email":"david.bauer009@gmail.com","name":"David Bauer"},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","email":"qiwu@nvidia.com","name":"Qi Wu"},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen","email":"h.gadirov@rug.nl","name":"Hamid Gadirov"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"david.bauer009@gmail.com","name":"David Bauer"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"david.bauer009@gmail.com","name":"David Bauer"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945520804827216","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"99d47ba0-22e8-4d68-9484-346e6fc722b8","keywords":["Radiance caching","path tracing","volume rendering","gaussian splatting"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1100-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTEwMC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.2y2bNyzkMX52ICLA9Nccye_l0c9TRfdzSwdhlNMu2zg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1100-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=6b96d726f238484d999aed99c74488e201abf96aed57b67559f340d796fdda04","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1100-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=ac33b7381109e73467d94b09c4b1acdec992e568936446a3e88d11d7d32e4474","practitioners_statement":"This work would be interesting to simulation scientists, scientific rendering specialists, and computer graphics researchers.\n\nThe technique could support practitioners in creating more performant, higher-quality rendering systems using the presented radiance cache.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19718","program_paper_id":"1100","title":"GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D Gaussian Splatting","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm for time-varying volumetric data compression and representation, owing to their ability to model high-dimensional signals effectively. INRs represent scalar fields based on sampled coordinates, typically using either a single network for the entire field or multiple networks across different spatial domains. However, these approaches often face challenges in modeling complex patterns and introducing boundary artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-INR, an INR architecture based on a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. MoE-INR automates irregular subdivisions of spatiotemporal fields and dynamically assigns them to different expert networks. The architecture comprises three key components: a policy network, a shared encoder, and multiple expert decoders. The policy network subdivides the field and determines which expert decoder is responsible for a given input coordinate. The shared encoder extracts hidden representations from the input coordinates, and the expert decoders transform these high-dimensional features into scalar values. This design results in a unified framework accommodating diverse INR types, including conventional, grid-based, and ensemble. We evaluate the effectiveness of MoE-INR on multiple time-varying datasets with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-INR significantly outperforms existing non-MoE and MoE-based INRs and traditional lossy compression methods across quantitative and qualitative metrics under various compression ratios.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.772067+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9af6703f-fc27-4be6-a995-f84e8091b517","keywords":["Time-varying data compression","implicit neural representation","volume visualization","mixture-of-experts"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1023-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTAyMy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjYyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjJ9.n8moh3uK60FRB9qvPPqWOSFYUnckICZpHU_ESpQZi6c","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1023-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=5438629085ccfd85887afa6714eda3bc711a430556913f3d75c70359020046c1","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1023-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=3d9177d3782fc2aa0a822cab3aa3054187f052ff8b9d48d0a58bd93059bf29b1","practitioners_statement":"simulation scientists and data scientists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1023","title":"MoE-INR: Implicit Neural Representation with Mixture-of-Experts for Time-Varying Volumetric Data Compression","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We conduct a deconstructive reading of a qualitative interview study with 17 visual data journalists from newsrooms across the globe. We borrow a deconstruction approach from literary critique to explore the instability of meaning in language and reveal implicit beliefs in words and ideas. Through our analysis we surface two sets of opposing implicit beliefs in visual data journalism: objectivity/subjectivity and humanism/mechanism. We contextualize these beliefs through a genealogical analysis, which brings deconstruction theory into practice by providing a historic backdrop for these opposing perspectives. Our analysis shows that these beliefs held within visual data journalism are not self-enclosed but rather a product of external societal forces and paradigm shifts over time. Through this work, we demonstrate how thinking with critical theories such as deconstruction and genealogy can reframe success in visual data storytelling and diversify visualization research outcomes. These efforts push the ways in which we as researchers produce domain knowledge to examine the sociotechnical issues of today's values towards datafication and data visualization.

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples.\nTo address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Sichuan University","email":"wangqipengscu@stu.scu.edu.cn","name":"Qipeng Wang"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Sichuan University","email":"zhumin@scu.edu.cn","name":"Min Zhu"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","name":"Huamin Qu"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Sichuan University","email":"wangqipengscu@stu.scu.edu.cn","name":"Qipeng Wang"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Sichuan University","email":"zhumin@scu.edu.cn","name":"Min Zhu"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","name":"Huamin Qu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wangqipengscu@stu.scu.edu.cn","name":"Qipeng Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"wangqipengscu@stu.scu.edu.cn","name":"Qipeng Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9d6c7874-e4fa-449b-88aa-4b3937241e7d","keywords":["Visual Analytics","Single-cell RNA Sequencing","Cell Developmental Trajectories"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ETFJ2","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1247-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTI0Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.9iRGag6Yqhwayc6GprCKUN-T9kpYqvse_UPxIZdhrHQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1247-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=86b187ed0864fdb6fd61a46d2b1296a4a920f081f2315f42159e7cff2483360e","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1247-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=2cf86aed80fab279b144dfad29e1c9eb6975967b52ab8e7f2a118ce3ddcc22b7","practitioners_statement":"Biologists interested in bioinformatics","preprint_link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15620","program_paper_id":"1247","title":"TrajLens: Visual Analysis for Constructing Cell Developmental Trajectories in Cross-Sample Exploration","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users initially access core functionalities\u2014such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis\u2014through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system\u2019s adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., \u201cvisualize the skull\u201d or \u201chighlight tissue boundaries\u201d). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ayanju04@gmail.com","name":"Ayan Biswas"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"tlturton@lanl.gov","name":"Terece Turton"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ranasinghe@lanl.gov","name":"Nishath Ranasinghe"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"smjones@lanl.gov","name":"Shawn Jones"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"love@lanl.gov","name":"Bradley Love"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"wjones@lanl.gov","name":"William Jones"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"hagberg@lanl.gov","name":"Aric Hagberg"},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"shen.94@osu.edu","name":"Han-Wei Shen"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ndebard@lanl.gov","name":"Nathan Debardeleben"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"earl@lanl.gov","name":"Earl Lawrence"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ayanju04@gmail.com","name":"Ayan Biswas"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"tlturton@lanl.gov","name":"Terece Turton"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ranasinghe@lanl.gov","name":"Nishath Ranasinghe"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"smjones@lanl.gov","name":"Shawn Jones"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"love@lanl.gov","name":"Bradley Love"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"wjones@lanl.gov","name":"William Jones"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"hagberg@lanl.gov","name":"Aric Hagberg"},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"shen.94@osu.edu","name":"Han-Wei Shen"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ndebard@lanl.gov","name":"Nathan Debardeleben"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"earl@lanl.gov","name":"Earl Lawrence"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ayanju04@gmail.com","name":"Ayan Biswas"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ayanju04@gmail.com","name":"Ayan Biswas"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9e05775a-056c-42f7-a3c2-e81281c5045a","keywords":["Scientific data","Large language models","Agentic workflows","Natural language","Feature-based visualization."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1626-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTYyNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.IsW0mEAI5AbfiO2_ftTuEwciJGY9_7h8hTZ62OxOv2I","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1626-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=e249a2aa297363cb54fc4b367e68f43f6afa205e3187635f2eeec0c33c45c114","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1626-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=192c287560a2f4f3db366c6df47e942a62ad9b6d49b9b98b3b1c68a8a91512a2","practitioners_statement":"simulation scientists, data scientists\n\nThey can design a similar system to expedite the process of insight generation from their data.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21124","program_paper_id":"1626","title":"VizGenie: Toward Self-Refining, Domain-Aware Workflows for Next-Generation Scientific Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Sonification offers a non-visual way to understand data, with pitch-based encodings being the most common. Yet, how well people perceive slope and acceleration\u2014key features of data trends\u2014remains poorly understood. Drawing on people's natural abilities to perceive tempo, we introduce a novel sampling method for pitch-based sonification to enhance the perception of slope and acceleration in univariate functions. While traditional sonification methods often sample data at uniform x-spacing, yielding notes played at a fixed tempo with variable pitch intervals (Variable Pitch Interval), our approach samples at uniform y-spacing, producing notes with consistent pitch intervals but variable tempo (Variable Tempo). We conducted psychoacoustic experiments to understand slope and acceleration perception across three sampling methods: Variable Pitch Interval, Variable Tempo, and a Continuous (no sampling) baseline. In slope comparison tasks, Variable Tempo was more accurate than the other methods when modulated by the magnitude ratio between slopes. For acceleration perception, just-noticeable differences under Variable Tempo were over 13 times finer than with other methods. Participants also commonly reported higher confidence, lower mental effort, and a stronger preference for Variable Tempo compared to other methods. This work contributes models of slope and acceleration perception across pitch-based sonification techniques, introduces Variable Tempo as a novel and preferred sampling method, and provides promising initial evidence that leveraging timing can lead to more sensitive, accurate, and precise interpretation of derivative-based data features.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"danfan17@stanford.edu","name":"Danyang Fan"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"walksmit@stanford.edu","name":"Walker Smith"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"takako@ccrma.stanford.edu","name":"Takako Fujioka"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"cc@ccrma.stanford.edu","name":"Chris Chafe"},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan","email":"sileo@umich.edu","name":"Sile O'Modhrain"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"othello5@stanford.edu","name":"Diana Deutsch"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"sfollmer@stanford.edu","name":"Sean Follmer"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"danfan17@stanford.edu","name":"Danyang Fan"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"walksmit@stanford.edu","name":"Walker Smith"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"takako@ccrma.stanford.edu","name":"Takako Fujioka"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"cc@ccrma.stanford.edu","name":"Chris Chafe"},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan","email":"sileo@umich.edu","name":"Sile O'Modhrain"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"othello5@stanford.edu","name":"Diana Deutsch"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"sfollmer@stanford.edu","name":"Sean Follmer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"danfan17@stanford.edu","name":"Danyang Fan"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"danfan17@stanford.edu","name":"Danyang Fan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945524810514513","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9e3dfe2c-bbe4-4431-ae8b-1ee64a399c8b","keywords":["Visualization","Sonification","Empirical Studies","Auditory Perception"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/a4cth/?view_only=784965f9e9f64a3ea720cf53ff241481","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1627-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTYyNy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.zigl_2uz3hd0aRuEF-9W4juCczxyKJW9TRFGHaN0ZXI","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1627-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=d6e4c777589b93111dbfdf8955559d13adccf0fed53cdbc128fde31158a23ae5","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1627-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=d5a1520ecd36c0665a7fe05aa7c5ca9c6af805e61a2fa98d08a7300bc4583b35","practitioners_statement":"This research demonstrates that Variable Tempo sampling in pitch sonification\u2014sampling data at equal y-intervals to create tempo changes reflecting slope\u2014can enable more accurate and precise slope comparison and finer curvature discrimination compared to traditional pitch-based methods.

These articles often employ persuasive strategies, which are rhetorical techniques in narrative framing, visual rhetoric, or data presentation, to influence audience interpretation and opinion formation regarding information communication. While previous research has examined whether and when data visualizations persuade, the strategic choices made by persuaders remain largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, our work presents a taxonomy of persuasive strategies grounded in psychological theories and expert insights, categorizing 15 strategies across five dimensions: Credibility, Guided Interpretation, Reference-based Framing, Emotional Appeal, and Participation Invitation. To facilitate large-scale analysis, we curated a dataset of 936 data-driven news articles annotated with both persuasive strategies and their perceived effects. Leveraging this corpus, we developed a multimodal, multi-task learning model that jointly predicts the presence of persuasive strategies and their persuasive effects by incorporating both embedded (text and visualization) and explicit (visual narrative and psycholinguistic) features. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in identifying persuasive strategies and measuring their effects.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"2411927@tongji.edu.cn","name":"Zikai Li"},{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"chuyizheng02@gmail.com","name":"Chuyi Zheng"},{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"ankerlee168@gmail.com","name":"Ziang Li"},{"affiliation":"College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University","email":"shiyang1230@gmail.com","name":"Yang Shi"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"2411927@tongji.edu.cn","name":"Zikai Li"},{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"chuyizheng02@gmail.com","name":"Chuyi Zheng"},{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"ankerlee168@gmail.com","name":"Ziang Li"},{"affiliation":"College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University","email":"shiyang1230@gmail.com","name":"Yang Shi"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"2411927@tongji.edu.cn","name":"Zikai Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"2411927@tongji.edu.cn","name":"Zikai Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9e9a15b7-6ccb-4419-b391-e82e3bd8b907","keywords":["Data-driven storytelling","persuasive strategies","taxonomy","computational modeling"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1168-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTE2OC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDN9.9dJ0jbSx-SFbEKNdCbH7ueistzrGOHAxo4HYtzhV0t8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1168-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=5b6f18e88212b573327bd40ab857adc092feb5dc5f982533aa47b0781ff3de82","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1168-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=edeab3ea6ef870e8b3a571d92d489ac90ec554bb8fa71fb84ae2a0bdf814da78","practitioners_statement":"data scientists, data journalists, journalists, psychologists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1168","title":"Data Speaks, But Who Gives It a Voice?

We investigate the potential mismatch between familiar visual encodings and tactile perception in an exploratory study into the strategies employed by BLV people to measure common graphical primitives converted to tactile representations. First, we replicate the Cleveland and McGill study on graphical perception using swell form printing with eleven BLV subjects. Then, we present results from a group interview in which we describe the strategies used by our subjects to read four common chart types. While our results suggest that familiar encodings based on visual perception studies can be useful in tactile graphics, our subjects also expressed a desire to use encodings designed explicitly for BLV people.  Based on this study, we identify gaps between the perceptual expectations of common charts and the perceptual tools available in tactile perception. Then, we present a set of guidelines for the design of tactile graphics that accounts for these gaps.

One of the key challenges is the network complexity, which is composed of many node pairs distributed over the area. This spatial characteristic results in the high dimensional network problem in understanding the \u2018cause\u2019 of problems such as traffic congestion. Recent studies have proposed visual analytics systems aimed at understanding these underlying causes. Despite these efforts, the analysis of such causes is limited to identified patterns. However, given the intricate distribution of roads and their mutual influence, new patterns continuously emerge across all roads within urban transportation. At this stage, a well-defined visual analytics system can be a good solution for transportation practitioners. In this paper, we propose a system, CATOM (Causal Topology Map), for the cause-effect analysis of traffic patterns based on Granger causality for extracting causal topology maps. CATOM discovers causal relationships between roads through the Granger causality test and quantifies these relationships through the causal density. During the design process, the system was developed to fully utilize spatial information with visualization techniques to overcome the previous problems in the literature. We also evaluate the usability of our approach by conducting a SUS(System Usability Scale) test and traffic cause analysis with the real-world data from two study sites in collaboration with domain experts.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Chanyoung Jung"},{"email":null,"name":"Soobin Yim"},{"email":null,"name":"Giwoong Park"},{"email":null,"name":"Simon Oh"},{"email":null,"name":"Yun Jang"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Chanyoung Jung"},{"email":null,"name":"Soobin Yim"},{"email":null,"name":"Giwoong Park"},{"email":null,"name":"Simon Oh"},{"email":null,"name":"Yun Jang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"tn12qls@gmail.com","name":"Soobin Yim"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"tn12qls@gmail.com","name":"Soobin Yim"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.642805+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3489676","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"a049409b-b4a3-48ec-9f4e-83714ad50ba0","keywords":["Cause effect analysis","Time series analysis","Visual analytics","Roads","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Traffic congestion","Topology","Usability","Traffic control","Market research"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Traffic data scientists.

While visualization task taxonomies and typologies exist, they often focus on more granular analytical tasks that are too low-level to describe large complex decisions, which can make it difficult to reason about and design decision-support tools. In this paper, we contribute a typology of decision-making tasks that were iteratively refined from a list of design goals distilled from a literature review. Our typology is concise and consists of only three tasks: CHOOSE, ACTIVATE, and CREATE. Although decision types originating in other disciplines exist, we provide definitions for these tasks that are suitable for the visualization community. Our proposed typology offers two benefits. First, the ability to compose and hierarchically organize the tasks enables flexible and clear descriptions of decisions with varying levels of complexities. Second, the typology encourages productive discourse between visualization designers and domain experts by abstracting the intricacies of data, thereby promoting clarity and rigorous analysis of decision-making processes. We demonstrate the benefits of our typology through four case studies, and present an evaluation of the typology from semi-structured interviews with experienced members of the visualization community who have contributed to developing or publishing decision support systems for domain experts. Our interviewees used our typology to delineate the decision-making processes supported by their systems, demonstrating its descriptive capacity and effectiveness.

However, few projects examine how users organize their own visualization programs and how their coding choices may deviate from the intents of toolkit developers, impacting visualization prototyping and design. Further, is it possible to infer users\u2019 reasoning indirectly through their code, even when users copy code from other sources? We explore this question through a qualitative analysis of 715 D3 programs on Observable. We identify three levels of program organization based on how users decompose their code into smaller blocks: Program-, Chart-, and Component-Level code decomposition, with a strong preference for Component-Level reasoning. In a series of interviews, we corroborate that these levels reflect how Observable users reason about visualization programs. We compare common user-made components with those theorized in the Grammar of Graphics to assess overlap in user and toolkit developer reasoning. We find that, while the Grammar of Graphics covers basic visualizations well, it falls short in describing complex visualization types, especially those with animation, interaction, and parameterization components. Our findings highlight how user practices differ from formal grammars and reinforce ongoing efforts to rethink visualization toolkit support, including augmenting learning tools and AI assistants to better reflect real-world coding strategies.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","email":"lin.family.folders@gmail.com","name":"Melissa Lin"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"heerpate@cs.washington.edu","name":"Heer Patel"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"mlamkin@cs.washington.edu","name":"Medina Lamkin"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hbako@virginia.edu","name":"Hannah Bako"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"leibatt@cs.washington.edu","name":"Leilani Battle"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","email":"lin.family.folders@gmail.com","name":"Melissa Lin"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"heerpate@cs.washington.edu","name":"Heer Patel"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"mlamkin@cs.washington.edu","name":"Medina Lamkin"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hbako@virginia.edu","name":"Hannah Bako"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"leibatt@cs.washington.edu","name":"Leilani Battle"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"heerpate@cs.washington.edu","name":"Heer Patel"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"heerpate@cs.washington.edu","name":"Heer Patel"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.063302+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"a4b21717-3ef3-4fdf-b25a-30b41b9f0ef9","keywords":["Visualization toolkits","Code reuse."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/sudb8/?view_only=cc72bdc685804e478852a96297328eb8","open_access_supplemental_question":"We provided substantial supplemental of our transparent analysis practices and data.

Existing CA reconstruction methods often require extensive user interaction or large training datasets. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has successfully reconstructed high-fidelity scenes in natural and medical contexts without these requirements. However, challenges such as sparse-views, intra-scan motion, and complex vessel morphology hinder its direct application to CA data. We introduce NeRF-CA, a first step toward a fully automatic 4D CA reconstruction that achieves reconstructions from sparse coronary angiograms. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the challenges of sparse-views and cardiac motion by decoupling the scene into the moving coronary artery and the static background, effectively translating the problem of motion into a strength. NeRF-CA serves as a first stepping stone for solving the 4D CA reconstruction problem, achieving adequate 4D reconstructions from as few as four angiograms, as required by clinical practice, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art sparse-view X-ray NeRF. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively using representative 4D phantom datasets and ablation studies.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Kirsten W.H.

In doing so, we aim to bundle the existing research on these visualizations into a common concept and term that serves as a foundation and stepping stone for future developments in this direction.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Aarhus University","email":"meredithc@cs.au.dk","name":"Meredith Siang-Yun Chou"},{"affiliation":"Aarhus University","email":"hjschulz@cs.au.dk","name":"Hans-J\u00f6rg Schulz"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Aarhus University","email":"meredithc@cs.au.dk","name":"Meredith Siang-Yun Chou"},{"affiliation":"Aarhus University","email":"hjschulz@cs.au.dk","name":"Hans-J\u00f6rg Schulz"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"meredithc@cs.au.dk","name":"Meredith Siang-Yun Chou"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"meredithc@cs.au.dk","name":"Meredith Siang-Yun Chou"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:16.839835+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"a5a6c51f-9a92-459b-bbf9-0192d4c7f09f","keywords":["Charts","Diagrams","and Plots"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1263-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyNjMtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU3MywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTczfQ.jCc2okSnW47EWPg9O6JfDh4sH7E5m7muUc_fT76drlQ","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1263-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=2d3559b90bd76d090b43aa53eb5d41e136516d93923ee545c14d76eccb51e2a5","practitioners_statement":"This work provides the visualization community/ researchers with a foundation for future empirical studies and theoretical refinement.

In this paper, we report on a crowdsourced study to collect human ratings of perceived complexity for diverse visualizations. Using these ratings as ground truth, we then evaluated three methods to estimate this perceived complexity: image analysis metrics, multilinear regression using manually coded visualization features, and automated feature extraction using a large language model (LLM). Image complexity metrics showed no correlation with human-perceived visualization complexity. Manual feature coding produced a reasonable predictive model but required substantial effort. In contrast, a zero-shot LLM (GPT-4o mini) demonstrated strong capabilities in both rating complexity and extracting relevant features. Our findings suggest that visualization complexity is truly in the eye of the beholder, yet can be effectively approximated using zero-shot LLM prompting, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the complexity of visualizations.

Current approaches face significant limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to partial feature overfitting, and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel Crop-Smoothing technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations\u2014including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes.  A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"jwduan@csu.edu.cn","name":"Junwen Duan"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"234711076@csu.edu.cn","name":"Wei Xue"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"scv.kangziyao@gmail.com","name":"Ziyao Kang"},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","email":"shixia@tsinghua.edu.cn","name":"Shixia Liu"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"xiajiazhi@csu.edu.cn","name":"Jiazhi Xia"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"jwduan@csu.edu.cn","name":"Junwen Duan"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"234711076@csu.edu.cn","name":"Wei Xue"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"scv.kangziyao@gmail.com","name":"Ziyao Kang"},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","email":"shixia@tsinghua.edu.cn","name":"Shixia Liu"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"xiajiazhi@csu.edu.cn","name":"Jiazhi Xia"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"234711076@csu.edu.cn","name":"Wei Xue"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"234711076@csu.edu.cn","name":"Wei Xue"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"a79b8861-5ff1-41ab-ab84-c564496de8de","keywords":["Open-world object detection","data-efficient supervision","large language model","human-AI collaboration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1774-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc3NC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.BEGW-Le6DtEV9jjO9GwDXzuko0mWcfL3cxRGM2ja92U","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1774-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=f6d7cd02bdef53fa25a2a7093c2ee31fb91f4d13952fbff4068b03978648b9c7","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1774-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=29e6b6ea300d22c2f8df480083a3b263d71098e846f5b90559fbdbd440dcadb7","practitioners_statement":"Visualization Practitioners, AI Researchers, Computer Vision Specialists","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19870","program_paper_id":"1774","title":"OW-CLIP: Data-Efficient Visual Supervision for Open-World Object Detection via Human-AI Collaboration","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Data-rich documents are commonly found across various fields such as business, finance, and science.

To provide readers with satisfactory data stories, this paper presents Narrative Player, a novel method that automatically revives data narratives with consistent and contextualized visuals. Specifically, it accepts a paragraph and corresponding data table as input and leverages LLMs to characterize the clauses and extract contextualized data facts. Subsequently, the facts are transformed into a coherent visualization sequence with a carefully designed optimization-based approach. Animations are also assigned between adjacent visualizations to enable seamless transitions. Finally, the visualization sequence, transition animations, and audio narration generated by text-to-speech technologies are rendered into a data video.

However, position encodings can be susceptible to systematic biases depending on the intrinsic properties of the visualized data, such as its shape and cognitive processes of memory and perception. Using line charts as a case study, we investigate how the shape of data, such as local and global extrema, can bias the perception and recall of average data values. In two studies, participants estimated the average data values in a line chart by adjusting a slider with their mouse. We found that participants\u2019 estimates were systematically biased toward the direction of the global extremum. When multiple salient extrema were present, estimates appeared influenced by several extrema simultaneously but ultimately leaned toward the global extremum. \nNotably, the strength of this bias varied depending on whether participants were perceiving or recalling the mean. This work advances our understanding of how extrema influence perception and memory, potentially exaggerating or underestimating critical trends and contributing to a skewed interpretation of data. These findings offer valuable guidance for the design of narrative visualization tools and data storytelling strategies.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Emory University","email":"tsavalia@umass.edu","name":"Tejas Savalia"},{"affiliation":"US Naval Research Lab","email":"andrew.lovett@nrl.navy.mil","name":"Andrew Lovett"},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"crceja@u.northwestern.edu","name":"Cristina Ceja"},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","email":"rosie.cowell@colorado.edu","name":"Rosemary Cowell"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Emory University","email":"tsavalia@umass.edu","name":"Tejas Savalia"},{"affiliation":"US Naval Research Lab","email":"andrew.lovett@nrl.navy.mil","name":"Andrew Lovett"},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"crceja@u.northwestern.edu","name":"Cristina Ceja"},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","email":"rosie.cowell@colorado.edu","name":"Rosemary Cowell"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"tsavalia@umass.edu","name":"Tejas Savalia"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"tsavalia@umass.edu","name":"Tejas Savalia"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.605934+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"aa5d2960-377f-4f57-a6a1-0cb8c110af24","keywords":["Data visualization","Memory","Perception","Shape","Global Maxima and Minima"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1332-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzMzItZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY3fQ.rb_CLYRG9tq2Mmn5NcAwdwiQUPa6L8nHavE0UgJ1lj0","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1332-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=8372a5361ff75fc4ac025cb51e37dace37b23a42b18a023d9cf19be96464951f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1332-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=26c3eeba96004356a28a3b07f2c445b7ecde39cdf53f98d37769433a8ed159a9","practitioners_statement":"Our article provides experimental considerations for scientists who study the effects of visual representation of data.

This process demands skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools, highlighting the need for a more intelligent, streamlined VA approach. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been developed as agents to handle various tasks with dynamic planning and tool-using capabilities, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency and versatility of VA. We propose LightVA, a lightweight VA framework that supports task decomposition, data analysis, and interactive exploration through human-agent collaboration. Our method is designed to help users progressively translate high-level analytical goals into low-level tasks, producing visualizations and deriving insights. Specifically, we introduce an LLM agent-based task planning and execution strategy, employing a recursive process involving a planner, executor, and controller. The planner is responsible for recommending and decomposing tasks, the executor handles task execution, including data analysis, visualization generation and multi-view composition, and the controller coordinates the interaction between the planner and executor. Building on the framework, we develop a system with a hybrid user interface that includes a task flow diagram for monitoring and managing the task planning process, a visualization panel for interactive data exploration, and a chat view for guiding the model through natural language instructions. We examine the effectiveness of our method through a usage scenario and an expert study.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"email":null,"name":"Junjie Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Linbin Xiang"},{"email":null,"name":"Xiaowen Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Zifei Guo"},{"email":null,"name":"Cagatay Turkay"},{"email":null,"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Siming Chen"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"email":null,"name":"Junjie Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Linbin Xiang"},{"email":null,"name":"Xiaowen Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Zifei Guo"},{"email":null,"name":"Cagatay Turkay"},{"email":null,"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"email":null,"name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.54128+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3496112","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"aab34439-1bda-4a07-916a-80e89f82ff62","keywords":["Data visualization","Planning","Data analysis","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Market research","Data mining","Collaboration","Adaptation models"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data scientists, business intelligence professionals, visualization experts, and developer of LLM-powered tools would benefit from this paper, as it offers a framework and implemented system for automating data analysis tasks and generating interactive visualizations.

These misperceptions inflame partisan animosity and may be used to justify extremism among one\u2019s own party. Research suggests that correcting partisan misperceptions\u2014by informing people about the actual views of outparty members\u2014may reduce one\u2019s own expressed support for political extremism, including partisan violence and anti-democratic actions. However, there remains a limited understanding of how the design of correction interventions drives these effects. The present study investigated how correction effects depend on different representations of outparty views communicated through data visualizations. Building on prior interventions that present the average outparty view, we consider the impact of visualizations that more fully convey the range of views among outparty members. We conducted an experiment with U.S.-based participants from Prolific (N=239 Democrats, N=244 Republicans). Participants made predictions about support for political violence and undemocratic practices among members of their political outparty. They were then presented with data from an earlier survey on the actual views of outparty members. Some participants viewed only the average response (Mean-Only condition), while other groups were shown visual representations of the range of views from 75% of the outparty (Mean+Interval condition) or the full distribution of responses (Mean+Points condition). Compared to a control group that was not informed about outparty views, we observed the strongest correction effects (i.e., lower support for political violence and undemocratic practices) among participants in the Mean-only and Mean+Points condition, while correction effects were weaker in the Mean+Interval condition. In addition, participants who observed the full distribution of out-party views (Mean+Points condition) were most accurate at later recalling the degree of support among the outparty. Our findings suggest that data visualizations can be an important tool for correcting pervasive distortions in beliefs about other groups. However, the way in which variability in outparty views is visualized can significantly shape how people interpret and respond to corrective information.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"dmarkant@uncc.edu","name":"Doug Markant"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"ssah1@uncc.edu","name":"Subham Sah"},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","email":"akarduni@sfu.ca","name":"Alireza Karduni"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"mrogha@uncc.edu","name":"Milad Rogha"},{"affiliation":"University of Florida","email":"mythai@cise.ufl.edu","name":"My Thai"},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","email":"wdou1@uncc.edu","name":"Wenwen Dou"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"dmarkant@uncc.edu","name":"Doug Markant"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"ssah1@uncc.edu","name":"Subham Sah"},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","email":"akarduni@sfu.ca","name":"Alireza Karduni"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"mrogha@uncc.edu","name":"Milad Rogha"},{"affiliation":"University of Florida","email":"mythai@cise.ufl.edu","name":"My Thai"},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","email":"wdou1@uncc.edu","name":"Wenwen Dou"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"dmarkant@uncc.edu","name":"Doug Markant"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"dmarkant@uncc.edu","name":"Doug Markant"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ad323fdf-97c1-4e09-a814-a643243d280b","keywords":["uncertainty visualization","political communication","partisan misperception"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/8crsp/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1695-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTY5NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzZ9.ShXOq5J3ifh-_RJYMcTKDBrO77jHZsmYAqpZgPfJJSU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1695-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=126e8619c8dfef7161409e1e307167acabf7c57b54d16451d1af0e37e1d8aea6","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1695-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=23f02a3ee71e1ec220c72f79e7bccd4c86c3f35e3c7bd6118460fe8af84694eb","practitioners_statement":"This paper might be of interest to people who broadly work on topics in the social and political sciences, including the use of data visualizations to communicate public opinion on divisive or controversial issues.

Standards like the WCAG2 contrast ratio are intended to guide designers toward accessible color use but are increasingly misapplied as oversimplified and misunderstood shortcuts for achieving perceptual accessibility. This misuse highlights the need for more nuanced, perceptually grounded evaluation tools. In response, we present our Modular Accessible Perceptibility (MAP) contrast model and tool, which integrates advanced color appearance models to assess perceptibility and flag risks associated with simultaneous contrast. By augmenting the CAM16-UCS model with a CAM16 CCz simultaneous chromatic contrast calculation, our model can isolate and measure the predicted shift resulting from simultaneous contrast along the chroma axis. This enables a more refined evaluation of visual contrast that better reflects the complexities of human color perception. Additionally, our tool performs modularly segmented automated checks to assign MAP contrast index scores, offering a holistic assessment of a map\u2019s visual accessibility.

Visual Graph Querying (VGQ) streamlines this process by enabling users to construct and execute queries via an interactive interface without resorting to complex coding. However, current VGQ tools only allow users to construct simple and specific query graphs, limiting users' ability to interactively express their query intent, especially for underspecified query intent. To address these limitations, we propose Envisage, an interactive visual graph querying system to enhance the expressiveness of VGQ in complex query scenarios by supporting intuitive graph structure construction and flexible parameterized rule specification. Specifically, Envisage comprises four stages: Query Expression allows users to interactively construct graph queries through intuitive operations; Query Verification enables the validation of constructed queries via rule verification and query instantiation; Progressive Query Execution can progressively execute queries to ensure meaningful querying results; and Result Analysis facilitates result exploration and interpretation. To evaluate Envisage, we conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 14 graph analysts. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in constructing, verifying, and executing complex graph queries.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"qishuang.fu@monash.edu","name":"Qishuang Fu"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"shuangyu001@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Shuangyue Han"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yguo017@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yichen Guo"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"joseph.liu@monash.edu","name":"Joseph Liu"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"qishuang.fu@monash.edu","name":"Qishuang Fu"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"shuangyu001@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Shuangyue Han"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yguo017@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yichen Guo"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"joseph.liu@monash.edu","name":"Joseph Liu"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ae49090b-23a7-453b-8d5d-eb0ad8893a08","keywords":["Visual graph querying","interactive query construction","graph data"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Selvalim/VGQ-front","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1567-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU2Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.rzuAUMg7XFNjDDwlsThoiJeFQZcTeIM3-7COVL_v98I","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1567-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=8b95007e89296ce15299d5427c6c296f48924d1b2a1d942f66ee272ec3739077","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1567-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=53026865ca93e2a75a4d9299a4664a79f11139f1e49113ad07ba6f7957cf0181","practitioners_statement":"Graph analyst, visualization researcher\n\nThey can use our tool to conduct the graph querying and learn the interaction design of our tools.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11999","program_paper_id":"1567","title":"Envisage: Towards Expressive Visual Graph Querying","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Dashboards remain ubiquitous tools for analyzing data and disseminating the findings. Understanding the range of dashboard designs, from simple to complex, can support development of authoring tools that enable end-users to meet their analysis and communication goals. Yet, there has been little work that provides a quantifiable, systematic, and descriptive overview of dashboard design patterns. Instead, existing approaches only consider a handful of designs, which limits the breadth of patterns that can be surfaced. More quantifiable approaches, inspired by machine learning (ML), are presently limited to single visualizations or capture narrow features of dashboard designs. To address this gap, we present an approach for modeling the content and composition of dashboards using a graph representation. The graph decomposes dashboard designs into nodes featuring content \u201cblocks\u2019; and uses edges to model \u201crelationships\u201d, such as layout proximity and interaction, between nodes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, and its extension over prior work, we apply this representation to derive a census of 25,620 dashboards from Tableau Public, providing a descriptive overview of the core building blocks of dashboards in the wild and summarizing prevalent dashboard design patterns. We discuss concrete applications of both a graph representation for dashboard designs and the resulting census to guide the development of dashboard authoring tools, making dashboards accessible, and for leveraging AI/ML techniques. Our findings underscore the importance of meeting users where they are by broadly cataloging dashboard designs, both common and exotic.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Arjun Srinivasan"},{"email":null,"name":"Joanna Purich"},{"email":null,"name":"Michael Correll"},{"email":null,"name":"Leilani Battle"},{"email":null,"name":"Vidya Setlur"},{"email":null,"name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Arjun Srinivasan"},{"email":null,"name":"Joanna Purich"},{"email":null,"name":"Michael Correll"},{"email":null,"name":"Leilani Battle"},{"email":null,"name":"Vidya Setlur"},{"email":null,"name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ana.crisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ana.crisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.906116+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3490259","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"aeb6a938-4d06-4c0d-828a-6152918115c3","keywords":["Data visualization","Feature extraction","Manuals","Visualization","Authoring systems","Layout","Annotations","Training","Encoding","Systematics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"Large dataset of dashboards that we released","pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data Scientists, Business Analysts","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3490259","title":"From Dashboard Zoo to Census: A Case Study With Tableau Public","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Network visualizations are understudied in graphical perception. As a result, most network visualization designs still largely rely on designer intuition and algorithm optimizations rather than being guided by knowledge of human perception. The lack of perceptual understanding of network visualizations also limits the generalizability of past empirical evaluations, given their focus on performance over causal interpretation. To bridge this gap between perception and network visualization, we introduce a framework highlighting five key perceptual mechanisms used in node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices: attention, visual search, perceptual organization, ensemble coding, and object recognition. Our framework describes the role these perceptual mechanisms play in common network analytical tasks. We use the framework to revisit four past empirical investigations and outline future design experiments that can help produce more perceptually effective network visualizations. We anticipate this connection will afford translational understanding to guide more effective network visualization design and offer hypotheses for perception-aware network visualizations.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"S.

In this paper, we investigate how language models, including Word2Vec, RoBERTa, GPT-4o mini and the vision language model CLIP generate and represent nuanced semantically resonant colors for diverse concepts. To achieve this, we utilized a large dataset of color names and concepts, tailored models for the structure of each language model, and developed an interactive web interface, CONCEPT2COLOR, as a use case. Additionally, we conducted experiments and a detailed analysis to assess the ability of these models to generate meaningful colors. Through these experiments, we examined how factors such as model design, training data and context affect the color output. Our findings reveal the capabilities and limitations of language models in processing and generating semantically resonant colors for concepts, thus contributing insights into how they depict semantic color-concept connections. These insights have implications for data visualization, design, and human-computer interaction, where leveraging effective semantic color generation can enhance communication and user experience.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"ssalimaunti@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Shahreen Salim"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"tpial@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Tanzir Pial"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"ssalimaunti@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Shahreen Salim"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"tpial@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Tanzir Pial"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ssalimaunti@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Shahreen Salim"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"ssalimaunti@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Shahreen Salim"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"b00813fe-c0fb-4bdb-8040-b6e338088247","keywords":["Tabular Data","Text/Document Data","Datasets","Methodologies","Software Prototype","Domain Agnostic","Color Machine Learning Techniques"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1506-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUwNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzR9.RHtQ9p5gLNhMyIaq_A8fOEoBvyhNpndUme-jCO9KsVM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1506-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a0563fc75f1be47c8d1d07f98dfa145d9a5e4e3b43abfe4764e1a3d959b6387d","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1506-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=430c2427d29912a5999a2fd5edd4f902fedc6dee04be4156d79edd5709ccbba6","practitioners_statement":"This work will be of interest to anyone who needs to pick or evaluate color palettes for communication and design, including:\n\nInformation & Data Visualization Designers (in academia or industry), who want to automatically generate palettes that align with the semantics of their data categories.\n\nData Journalists & Reporters, who need on-the-fly, context-aware colors for charts and infographics to make stories more intuitive and engaging.\n\nUI/UX Designers & Front-end Developers, who can use semantic color mapping to theme components (alerts, statuses, notifications) based on message content or user sentiment.\n\nEducators & Instructional Designers, who create learning materials or e-learning modules and want color cues that reinforce key concepts or vocabulary.\n\nBranding & Marketing Professionals, who often start from keywords like \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ceco-friendly\u201d and need to translate those into on-brand color palettes quickly.\n\nAccessibility & Assistive-Tech Specialists, who can augment communication aids (e.g., emotion cards, schedules) with semantically meaningful colors to reduce ambiguity for neurodivergent or visually impaired users.","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1506","title":"What is the Color of Serendipity?

Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large-scale spatial time series analysis.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Zikun Deng"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiabao Huang"},{"email":null,"name":"Chenxi Ruan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jialing Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Shaowu Gao"},{"email":null,"name":"Yi Cai"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Zikun Deng"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiabao Huang"},{"email":null,"name":"Chenxi Ruan"},{"email":null,"name":"Jialing Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Shaowu Gao"},{"email":null,"name":"Yi Cai"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.988931+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3537115","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"b0a64ecf-d533-44dc-a3be-5f9194ce91d7","keywords":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Data visualization","Visualization","Time series analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)","Three-dimensional displays","Switches","Costs","Scalability","Market research"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"This work would be of interest to data scientists and visualization researchers who focus on geospatial data and urban data analytics, who require effective methods to explore temporal trends and spatial patterns simultaneously.

We draw from our experience designing data physicalization workshops and from reviewing three existing workshops, to distill the cookbook's core ingredient (context and goal) and eight additional ingredients related to making (material, tool, technique), data encoding (data type, variable, mark/unit), and interactivity (interaction, sensory modality). We then show how FlexPhys can be used to describe and compare physicalization workshops, and to generate workshops that address specific data physicalization research questions.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"bahare.bakhtiari97@gmail.com","name":"Bahare Bakhtiari"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1","email":"aurelien@tabard.fr","name":"Aur\u00e9lien Tabard"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"sowmya.somanath@gmail.com","name":"Sowmya Somanath"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"cperin@uvic.ca","name":"Charles Perin"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"bahare.bakhtiari97@gmail.com","name":"Bahare Bakhtiari"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1","email":"aurelien@tabard.fr","name":"Aur\u00e9lien Tabard"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"sowmya.somanath@gmail.com","name":"Sowmya Somanath"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"cperin@uvic.ca","name":"Charles Perin"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"bahare.bakhtiari97@gmail.com","name":"Bahare Bakhtiari"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"bahare.bakhtiari97@gmail.com","name":"Bahare Bakhtiari"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.501591+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"b2ea7546-bba9-4e9e-9d93-b7e43b147009","keywords":["data physicalization","methods","workshops"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1057-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEwNTctZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM4fQ.fmROOAa_5jpSG8B1S0xXrjcWNfLIf8pX8pxG_Bs0ggA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1057-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=1e5e6a4e9ae9d58e6d7f5a7da3cc8adc84bea323fd8c67671c4424a4c5888013","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1057-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=9f04932afddfa6a664d90caeaa1ad6d680ac43f5d0afacf9c7a7127409a65bec","practitioners_statement":"Researchers in the field of data visualization and data physicalization would be interested in reading this paper.

However, this approach overlooks the varying difficulty associated with different instances. Ideally, a robust model should recognize and reflect the challenges presented by intrinsically difficult instances. It is also valuable to investigate whether the difficulty perceived by the model aligns with that perceived by humans. To address this, we propose incorporating instance difficulty into the deep neural network evaluation process, specifically for supervised classification tasks on image data. Specifically, we consider difficulty measures from three perspectives -- data, model, and human -- to facilitate comprehensive evaluation and comparison. Additionally, we develop an interactive visual tool, DifficultyEyes, to support the identification of instances of interest based on various difficulty patterns and to aid in analyzing potential data or model issues.

Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps \u2014 a technique known as timeslicing \u2014 can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Raphael Tinarrage"},{"email":null,"name":"Jean R.

SynAnno integrates into existing neuroscience workflows by enabling guided, neuron-centric proofreading. To address the challenges posed by the complex spatial branching of neurons, it introduces a structured workflow with an optimized traversal path and a 3D mini-map for tracking progress. In addition, SynAnno incorporates fine-tuned machine learning models to assist with error detection and correction, reducing the manual burden and increasing proofreading efficiency.\nWe evaluate SynAnno through a user and case study involving seven neuroscience experts.

In contrast to dimensionality reduction (DR) methods designed only for analyzing a matrix (i.e., second-order tensor), existing tensor decomposition methods do not support flexible comparative analysis. To address this analysis limitation, we introduce a new tensor decomposition method, named tensor unified linear comparative analysis (TULCA), by extending its DR counterpart, ULCA, for tensor analysis. TULCA integrates discriminant analysis and contrastive learning schemes for tensor decomposition, enabling flexible comparison of tensors. We also introduce an effective method to visualize a core tensor extracted from TULCA into a set of 2D visualizations.

One recent class of methods to approach this problem is to first compute objective optimal reference frames, relative to which the input vector field becomes as steady as possible. However, existing methods either optimize locally over a fixed neighborhood, which might not match the extent of interesting features well, or perform global optimization, which is costly. We propose a novel objective method for the computation of optimal reference frames that automatically adapts to the flow field locally, without having to choose neighborhoods a priori. We enable adaptivity by formulating this problem as a moving least squares approximation, through which we determine a continuous field of reference frames. To incorporate fluid features into the computation of the reference frame field, we introduce the use of a scalar guidance field into the moving least squares approximation. The guidance field determines a curved manifold on which a regularly sampled input vector field becomes a set of irregularly spaced samples, which then forms the input to the moving least squares approximation. Although the guidance field can be any scalar field, by using a field that corresponds to flow features the resulting reference frame field will adapt accordingly. We show that using an FTLE field as the guidance field results in a reference frame field that adapts better to local features in the flow than prior work. However, our moving least squares framework is formulated in a very general way, and therefore other types of guidance fields could be used in the future to adapt to local fluid features.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology - KAUST","email":"julio.reyramirez@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Julio Rey Ramirez"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"peter.rautek@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Peter Rautek"},{"affiliation":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg","email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"markus.hadwiger@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Markus Hadwiger"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology - KAUST","email":"julio.reyramirez@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Julio Rey Ramirez"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"peter.rautek@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Peter Rautek"},{"affiliation":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg","email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"markus.hadwiger@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Markus Hadwiger"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"julio.reyramirez@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Julio Alberto Rey Ramirez"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"julio.reyramirez@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Julio Alberto Rey Ramirez"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"b71e9ec2-8579-410a-94c0-a9e2812a2712","keywords":["Scientific visualization","unsteady flow","reference frame optimization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1172-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTE3Mi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MjYzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAyNjN9.78GTaGloI7TAs3J-9fmByg1QPKPJIID7DkG6hQPYm1g","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1172-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=aeea7f3f54f385493bcd4c14f7125cbf9e9f46767499238e52da2f8488efc46a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1172-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=bc3011073e2a6e156ff14e31fa021d2f7d2577d2021f86601ab2d5aae0d26a4c","practitioners_statement":"Flow visualization scientists can apply this work to extend existing local reference frame optimization to turbulent flow, enabling the application of reference frame optimization in fields ranging from engineering to biomedical applications, where extracting vortex coreline geometry enables a quantitative study of the fluid dynamics","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1172","title":"Locally Adapted Reference Frame Fields using Moving Least Squares","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"This article introduces constraint-based breakpoints, a technique for designing responsive visualizations for a wide variety of screen sizes and datasets. Breakpoints in responsive visualization define when different visualization designs are shown. Conventionally, breakpoints are static, pre-defined widths, and as such do not account for changes to the visualized dataset or visualization parameters. To guarantee readability and efficient use of space across datasets, these static breakpoints would require manual updates. Constraint-based breakpoints solve this by evaluating visualization-specific constraints on the size of visual elements, overlapping elements, and the aspect ratio of the visualization and available space. Once configured, a responsive visualization with constraint-based breakpoints can adapt to different screen sizes for any dataset. We describe a framework that guides designers in creating a stack of visualization designs for different display sizes and defining constraints for each of these designs. We demonstrate constraint-based breakpoints for different data types and their visualizations: geographic data (choropleth map, proportional circle map, Dorling cartogram, hexagonal grid map, bar chart, waffle chart), network data (node-link diagram, adjacency matrix, arc diagram), and multivariate data (scatterplot, heatmap).","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Sarah Sch\u00f6ttler"},{"email":null,"name":"Jason Dykes"},{"email":null,"name":"Jo Wood"},{"email":null,"name":"Uta Hinrichs"},{"email":null,"name":"Benjamin Bach"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Sarah Sch\u00f6ttler"},{"email":null,"name":"Jason Dykes"},{"email":null,"name":"Jo Wood"},{"email":null,"name":"Uta Hinrichs"},{"email":null,"name":"Benjamin Bach"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"s.j.schottler@tue.nl","name":"Sarah Sch\u00f6ttler"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"s.j.schottler@tue.nl","name":"Sarah Sch\u00f6ttler"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.642805+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3410097","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"b75e4e38-595d-4c86-a824-7251ec305f19","keywords":["Data visualization","Visualization","Libraries","Manuals","Bars","Media","Layout"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Data journalists and other practitioners who create (or want to create) visualizations that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations. Based on our analysis, we provide recommendations and discuss broader implications for multimodal learning, AI applications, and visualization reproducibility.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","email":"huyen_nguyen@hms.harvard.edu","name":"Huyen N.

These complex spatial maps consist of tree-like neurons interconnected by synapses. Motif analysis is a widely used method for identifying recurring subgraph patterns in connectomes. These motifs, thus, potentially represent fundamental units of information processing. However, existing computational tools often oversimplify neurons as mere nodes in a graph, disregarding their intricate morphologies. In this paper, we introduce MoMo, a novel interactive visualization framework for analyzing neuron morphology-aware motifs in large connectome graphs. First, we propose an advanced graph data structure that integrates both neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. This enables highly efficient, parallel subgraph isomorphism searches, allowing for interactive morphological motif queries. Second, we develop a sketch-based interface that facilitates the intuitive exploration of morphology-based motifs within our new data structure. Users can conduct interactive motif searches on state-of-the-art connectomes and visualize results as interactive 3D renderings. We present a detailed goal and task analysis for motif exploration in connectomes, incorporating neuron morphology. Finally, we evaluate MoMo through case studies with four domain experts, who asses the tool\u2019s usefulness and effectiveness in motif exploration, and relevance to real-world neuroscience research.

This induces dynamics i.e., coupled changes in the electronic structure and nuclear geometry, that drive physical and chemical processes of importance in diverse fields ranging from photobiology and materials design to medicine. The evolving electronic structure can be characterized by two electron density fields: hole and particle natural transition orbitals (NTOs). A study of the two density fields helps understand the movement of electronic charge from one part of the molecule to another, specifically the donor and acceptor regions. Previous works in this area rely on side-by-side visual comparisons of isosurfaces, statistical approaches, or visual analysis of bivariate fields restricted to limited time instances. We propose a new method to analyze time-varying bivariate fields with a large number of instances, as pertinent to understand electronic structure changes during light-induced dynamics. Since the NTO fields depend on the nuclear geometry, the nuclear motion leads to a large number of bivariate field instances. Structures like tracking graphs have been used to analyze time-varying univariate fields. This article presents a structured and practical approach to feature-directed visual exploration of time-varying bivariate fields using continuous scatterplots (CSPs) and image moment-based descriptors, tailored for studying the evolving electronic structure following photoexcitation. The CSP of the bivariate field at every time step is represented using an image moment vector of length 4. The collection of all image moment vector descriptors is considered as a point cloud in R4 and visualized using principal component analysis. Choosing an appropriate pair of principal components results in a representation of the point cloud as a curve on the plane. This representation supports tasks such as identifying interesting time steps, identifying patterns within the bivariate field, and tracking their evolution over time. We present two case studies on excited-state dynamics in molecular systems that demonstrate how the time-varying bivariate field analysis helps provide application-specific insights.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Mohit Sharma"},{"email":null,"name":"Talha Bin Masood"},{"email":null,"name":"Nanna Holmgaard List"},{"email":null,"name":"Ingrid Hotz"},{"email":null,"name":"Vijay Natarajan"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Mohit Sharma"},{"email":null,"name":"Talha Bin Masood"},{"email":null,"name":"Nanna Holmgaard List"},{"email":null,"name":"Ingrid Hotz"},{"email":null,"name":"Vijay Natarajan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"mohit.sharma@liu.se","name":"Mohit Sharma"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"mohit.sharma@liu.se","name":"Mohit Sharma"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.642805+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3543619","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"bbb737fd-8e8d-4862-9427-e0a928f2051b","keywords":["Visualization","Atoms","Principal component analysis","Geometry","Electrons","Orbits","Pipelines","Manuals","Vectors","Training"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"Our supplementary material provides high-level implementation details, design choices, and approximate runtime estimates for key pipeline steps.

Visualizations of the dimensionally-reduced data enable scientists to delve into the intrinsic structures of their datasets and align them with established hypotheses. Visualization researchers have thus proposed many dimensionality reduction methods and interactive systems designed to uncover latent structures. At the same time, different scientific domains have formulated guidelines or common workflows for using dimensionality reduction techniques and visualizations for their respective fields. In this work, we present a critical analysis of the usage of dimensionality reduction in scientific domains outside of computer science. First, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of 21,249 academic publications that use dimensionality reduction to observe differences in the frequency of techniques across fields. Next, we conduct a survey of a 71-paper sample from four fields: biology, chemistry, physics, and business. Through this survey, we uncover common workflows, processes, and usage patterns, including the mixed use of confirmatory data analysis to validate a dataset and projection method and exploratory data analysis to then generate more hypotheses. We also find that misinterpretations and inappropriate usage is common, particularly in the visual interpretation of the resulting dimensionally reduced view. Lastly, we compare our observations with recent works in the visualization community in order to match work within our community to potential areas of impact outside our community.

When these characters belong to different groups, a new research question emerges: how can we balance optimization of readability across the groups while preserving the overall narrative structure of the story? Traditional algorithms that optimize global readability metrics (like minimizing crossings) can introduce quality biases between the different groups based on their cardinality and other aspects of the data. Visual consequences of these biases are: making characters of minority groups disproportionately harder to follow, and visually deprioritizing important characters when their curves become entangled with numerous secondary characters. We present F2Stories, a modular framework that addresses these challenges in storylines by offering three complementary optimization modes: (1) fairnessMode ensures that no group bears a disproportionate burden of visualization complexity regardless of their representation in the story; (2) focusMode allows prioritizing a group of characters while maintaining good readability for secondary characters; and (3) standardMode globally optimizes classical aesthetic metrics. Our approach is based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), offering optimality guarantees, precise balancing of competing metrics through weighted objectives, and the flexibility to incorporate complex fairness concepts as additional constraints without the need to redesign the entire algorithm. We conducted an extensive experimental analysis to demonstrate how F2Stories enables more fair or focus group-prioritized storyline visualizations while maintaining adherence to established layout constraints.

According to the originally recommended implementation, a 3D tricubic B-spline reconstruction is applied to evaluate true samples along the rays, while between the true samples, virtual samples are calculated by using a 1D Catmull-Rom spline interpolation. The virtual samples can be evaluated much faster, but they can still well approximate the true samples. Therefore, the rendering performance can be drastically improved at the cost of a very slight quality degradation. Nevertheless, in this paper, we show that the original virtual sampling scheme does not exploit the fact, that the applied tricubic B-spline reconstruction filter together with its analytic derivative filters provide Hermite samples. Therefore, it is more natural to use Hermite interpolation along the rays rather than Catmull-Rom spline interpolation. From a sampling-theoretical point of view, this modification requires half of the true samples to guarantee the same reconstruction quality. Furthermore, concerning the evaluation of the true samples, we also investigate a recently published GPU-accelerated triquadratic B-spline filtering as an alternative of the tricubic B-spline filtering.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","email":"cseb@iit.bme.hu","name":"Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e9bfalvi"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","email":"cseb@iit.bme.hu","name":"Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e9bfalvi"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"cseb@iit.bme.hu","name":"Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e9bfalvi"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"cseb@iit.bme.hu","name":"Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e9bfalvi"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.174731+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"be118d02-63d2-4463-a135-af2c23073ad2","keywords":["Direct volume rendering","reconstruction filtering","virtual sampling."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1216-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMTYtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY3fQ.0hmpLgsDYzCYVHxOrjywM57shSH_CTZ3NeNabvtRjuY","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1216-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=6e000bd2138d81d08e4f1f7c8489133c0fa636a31e6046eb6c0e1c57fff6c4c2","practitioners_statement":"Everybody who develops volume-rendering algorithms would be potentially interested in reading this paper.

For example, \u201crough\u201d, when split according to phonemes, is decomposed as r-ou-gh (not as r-o-ugh or r-ough), where\neach group of letters corresponds to a sound. Since there are many ways to segment a group of letters, this constitutes a computational\noperation that has to be solved by the reading brain, many times per minute, in order to achieve the recognition of words in text\nnecessary for reading. In English, the irregular relationships between groups of letters and sounds, and the wide variety of possible\ngroupings make this operation harder than in more regular languages such as Italian. If this segmentation takes a significant amount of\ntime in the process of recognizing a word, it is conceivable that providing segmentation information in the text itself could help the\nreading process by reducing its computational cost. In this paper we explore whether and how different visual interventions from the\nvisualization literature could communicate segmentation information for reading and word recognition. We ran a series of pre-registered\nlexical decision experiments with 192 participants that tested five main types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections,\nunderlines and color. The evidence indicates that, even with a moderate amount of training, these visual interventions always slow\ndown word identification, but each to a different extent (between 32.7ms\u2014color technique\u2014and 70.7ms\u2014connection technique).\nThese findings are important because they indicate that, at least for typical adult readers with a moderate amount of specific training in\nthese visual interventions, accelerating the lexical decision task is unlikely. Importantly, the results also offer an empirical measurement\nof the cost of a common set of visual manipulations of text, which can be useful for practitioners seeking to visualize alongside or within\ntext without impacting reading performance. Finally, the interaction between typographically encoded information and visual variables\npresented unique patterns that deviate from existing theories, suggesting new directions for future inquiry.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"matttermuende@gmail.com","name":"Matthew Termuende"},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","email":"kevlar@microsoft.com","name":"Kevin Larson"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"nacenta@gmail.com","name":"Miguel Nacenta"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"matttermuende@gmail.com","name":"Matthew Termuende"},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","email":"kevlar@microsoft.com","name":"Kevin Larson"},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","email":"nacenta@gmail.com","name":"Miguel Nacenta"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"matttermuende@gmail.com","name":"Matthew Termuende"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"matttermuende@gmail.com","name":"Matthew Termuende"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"bf10121c-1a25-4391-b766-450e53b2348e","keywords":["Reading","Word Recognition","Text Visualization","Text Interaction","Phonological Cues"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/79Y5S","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1789-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc4OS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.cCIeKxG8EIJjp6eEwrcD6XGjlAyO2a32RTsz7A_ohyM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1789-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=93176c0ff0a30c25d8ea1db214e1a86472fede079aaebe683dfa3f812882b7b6","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1789-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a8cd22037ec8002913abc7ee67092fa8657c77ab4a36395beab9246ece351d9c","practitioners_statement":"Visualization designers, reading researchers, and designers of reading enhancements would be interested in reading this paper.

knowledge required for driving breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug development. While traditional hypothesis-driven research has proven effective, it is constrained by human cognitive limitations, the complexity of biological systems, and the high costs associated with trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated scientific progress. However, the sheer volume of predictions they generate makes manual selection for experimental validation impractical. Attempts to leverage large language models (LLMs) for filtering predictions and generating novel hypotheses have been impeded by issues such as hallucinations and the lack of structured knowledge grounding, which undermine their reliability. To address these challenges, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance scientific discovery and validation visually. HypoChainer operates through three key stages: (1) Exploration and Contextualization: Domain experts employ retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction techniques to extract insights and research entry points from vast GNN predictions, supplemented by interactive explanations for in-depth understanding; (2) Hypothesis Chain Formation: Experts iteratively explore the relationships between KG information relevant to the predictions and semantically linked nodes consistent with the hypothesis, gaining knowledge and insights while refining the hypothesis through suggestions from LLMs and KGs; and (3) Validation Prioritization: Predictions are filtered and prioritized based on the refined hypothesis chains and KG-supported evidence, identifying high-priority candidates for experimental validation. Weak points in the hypothesis chain are further optimized through visual analytics of the retrieval results. We evaluated the effectiveness of HypoChainer in hypothesis construction and scientific discovery through case studies in two distinct domains and expert interviews.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"shishh2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Shaohan Shi"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"jianghr2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Haoran Jiang"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"yaoyj2024@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Yunjie Yao"},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Clinical Research and Trial Center","email":"cjiang_fdu@yeah.net","name":"Chang Jiang"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"liquan@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Quan Li"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"shishh2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Shaohan Shi"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"jianghr2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Haoran Jiang"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"yaoyj2024@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Yunjie Yao"},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Clinical Research and Trial Center","email":"cjiang_fdu@yeah.net","name":"Chang Jiang"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"liquan@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Quan Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jianghr2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Haoran Jiang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jianghr2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Haoran Jiang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"c06df49a-9aa2-40f9-94b9-23789ec137b8","keywords":["Large Language Model","Visual Analytics","Iterative Human-AI Collaboration","Knowledge Graph","Hypothesis Construction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1399-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTM5OS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDJ9.uqob9O2eV8mKwyMoelby34k0iEE42K_bsg1dL0VrQws","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1399-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=0aac926027fca65d8a836215cd691d8ebb7a674984a73635bc2377a1e0d3dbaf","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1399-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=8907e3e3674dcc41deaa6d9001226b7e73505beb16748e5ac578ebaa45678cf6","practitioners_statement":"Researchers engaged in scientific discovery, professionals in biology or related fields, and scholars in the field of visualization.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17209","program_paper_id":"1399","title":"HypoChainer: A Collaborative System Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Hypothesis-Driven Scientific Discovery","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset~\\cite{Chen21}. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications-colormap adjustment and colormap transfer-and explore its generalization  to  visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color palettes.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"liuhongxu_0227@163.com","name":"Hongxu Liu"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"xinyu.chen0468@gmail.com","name":"Xinyu Chen"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"zhenghaoyang1229@163.com","name":"Haoyang Zheng"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"manyili@sdu.edu.cn","name":"Manyi Li"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"liuzhenfannn@163.com","name":"Zhenfan Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland College Park","email":"fumeng.p.yang@gmail.com","name":"Fumeng Yang"},{"affiliation":"Renmin University of China","email":"cloudseawang@gmail.com","name":"Yunhai Wang"},{"affiliation":"Shandong Univ.","email":"changhe.tu@gmail.com","name":"Changhe Tu"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"qiong.zn@sdu.edu.cn","name":"Qiong Zeng"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"liuhongxu_0227@163.com","name":"Hongxu Liu"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"xinyu.chen0468@gmail.com","name":"Xinyu Chen"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"zhenghaoyang1229@163.com","name":"Haoyang Zheng"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"manyili@sdu.edu.cn","name":"Manyi Li"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"liuzhenfannn@163.com","name":"Zhenfan Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland College Park","email":"fumeng.p.yang@gmail.com","name":"Fumeng Yang"},{"affiliation":"Renmin University of China","email":"cloudseawang@gmail.com","name":"Yunhai Wang"},{"affiliation":"Shandong Univ.","email":"changhe.tu@gmail.com","name":"Changhe Tu"},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","email":"qiong.zn@sdu.edu.cn","name":"Qiong Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"qiong.zn@sdu.edu.cn","name":"Dr. Qiong Zeng"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"qiong.zn@sdu.edu.cn","name":"Dr. Qiong Zeng"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"c1893c22-b83f-4f15-82d7-c8f37bd65213","keywords":["Colormap","color design","2D scalar field visualization","reverse engineering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/gb2tx/?view_only=4d2a269b59bc4144b2806ec2d1a34e11","open_access_supplemental_question":"This work addresses the challenge of recovering a continuous colormap from a 2D scalar field visualization without a corresponding color legend.

Some of these relate to unstructured data, which, even on a single node, is much more expensive to render compared to structured volume data. Worse yet, in the data parallel rendering context, such data with highly non-convex spatial domain boundaries will cause rays along its silhouette to enter and leave a given rank's domains at different distances. This straddling, in turn, poses challenges for both ray marching, which usually assumes successive elements to share a face, and compositing, which usually assumes a single fragment per pixel per rank. We holistically address these issues using a combination of three inter-operating techniques: first, we use a highly optimized GPU ray marching technique that, given an entry point, can march a ray to its exit point with high-performance by exploiting an exclusive-or (XOR) based compaction scheme. Second, we use hardware-accelerated ray tracing to efficiently find the proper entry points for these marching operations. Third, we use a \u201cdeep\u201d compositing scheme to properly handle cases where different ranks\u2019 ray segments interleave in depth.

Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"hbraun5@wisc.edu","name":"Halle Braun"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","email":"kushinm11@gmail.com","name":"Kushin Mukherjee"},{"affiliation":"Woodwell Climate Research Center","email":"sgorelik@woodwellclimate.org","name":"Seth Gorelik"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"hbraun5@wisc.edu","name":"Halle Braun"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","email":"kushinm11@gmail.com","name":"Kushin Mukherjee"},{"affiliation":"Woodwell Climate Research Center","email":"sgorelik@woodwellclimate.org","name":"Seth Gorelik"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"c9fcc45e-0f81-49be-817e-b813e0b61c89","keywords":["Visual reasoning","visual communication","color cognition","affective science","emotion","scalar field","data-aware design"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/SchlossVRL/color_scales_affect","open_access_supplemental_question":"We have posted all of our data and analysis code on GitHub and have documented our code.","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1682-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTY4Mi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTU3LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1NTd9.NQ8_r_0OAM9vZ5qljk65-IDP0m8AHBZG_YWYL2lYePo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1682-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=93fe90ec1752033db9d49e5a55338b470291cf3f2efe5d2c81a365c86ed48184","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1682-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=f2ec00b1437d8d34e211dd171a95b893f228ef994dbc15de98d1e802f952c688","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners who use color in visualization design may be interested in our findings on factors that influence the affective (emotional) connotation of colormap data visualizations.

Unlike its traditional visualization, the organization of chromatin is 3D and can be measured with whole-genome sequencing technologies such as Hi-C sequencing, the results of which are often graphically represented as flat 2D heat-maps or a 1D curve that looks like a hairball. Here we discuss a novel approach to represent these and other genomic data by transforming the visualization of the genome from a 1D curve embedded in 3D into a structured 3D volume. This abstraction prioritizes 3D spatial proximity of chromatin and enables advanced techniques like clipping, thresholding, and contouring. Our method allows for multi-variable encoding, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret multivariate relationships, offering a more complete and effective representation of genomic structures, chromosome organization, and data relationships.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"bujack@lanl.gov","name":"Roxana Bujack"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"dhr@lanl.gov","name":"David Rogers"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"croth@lanl.gov","name":"Cullen Roth"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"emsmall@lanl.gov","name":"Eric Small"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"baners4@lanl.gov","name":"Banerjee Shounak"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"vrindavenu7@gmail.com","name":"Vrinda Venu"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"shawns@lanl.gov","name":"Shawn Starkenburg"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"crsteadman@lanl.gov","name":"Steadman, Christina Rene"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"bujack@lanl.gov","name":"Roxana Bujack"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"dhr@lanl.gov","name":"David Rogers"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"croth@lanl.gov","name":"Cullen Roth"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"emsmall@lanl.gov","name":"Eric Small"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"baners4@lanl.gov","name":"Banerjee Shounak"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"vrindavenu7@gmail.com","name":"Vrinda Venu"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"shawns@lanl.gov","name":"Shawn Starkenburg"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"crsteadman@lanl.gov","name":"Steadman, Christina Rene"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"bujack@lanl.gov","name":"Dr. Roxana Bujack"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"bujack@lanl.gov","name":"Dr. Roxana Bujack"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.501591+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"cab72096-2336-4e27-a4e2-c416dd102259","keywords":["Genome","volume","DNA","3D Hi-C","volumetric","abstraction."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1220-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMjAtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY4fQ.d0t5C-Qzdr24boBak8YXCmE2mMlvBC_fKz3HnMXo5dQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1220-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=8155edc26f33574387bb2ece9042fa8180a3058f3398d028608b8a35dab23e7a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1220-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=a55529b365a131963f3f8a0752d60adb144c90601d6f7aea77a54b0db0e61bdd","practitioners_statement":"biologists, genomics researchers, epigenomics researchers","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1220","title":"Volumetric Visualization of the Genome","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Our society increasingly depends on intelligent systems to solve complex problems, ranging from recommender systems suggesting the next movie to watch to AI models assisting in medical diagnoses for hospitalized patients.

Viewers are prone to misinterpret the direction of time in these visualizations, possibly because they encode time with an unexpected rule \u2013 along the connected line (TIME IS A LINE) instead of from left to right (RIGHT IS LATER) as conventional in line charts. In this paper, we use the connected scatterplot to illustrate a perspective on visualization comprehension centered around expectations of encoding rules. People have initial expectations of encoding rules for visualizations that can stem from conventional practices or metaphors, and these expectations have been recognized as a potential factor influencing visualization comprehension. We present three preregistered experiments (n = 1429 in total) demonstrating two kinds of design interventions to strengthen the correct expectation for time and testing their effectiveness in reducing errors for understanding realistic connected scatterplots. We found that visual treatments that suppress the incorrect chart-type expectation and directional cues that emphasize the correct expectation both led viewers to expect TIME IS A LINE more. An explicit directional cue (arrows), ideally redundantly encoded with another cue (trace-line effect or animation), was most effective for reducing misinterpretations. Our findings not only provide practical guidelines for designing connected scatterplots but also contribute theoretical insights to inform the design of novel visualizations that challenge interpretability by defying expectations.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"wenxuxmn@gmail.com","name":"Wen Xu"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","name":"Lace Padilla"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"wenxuxmn@gmail.com","name":"Wen Xu"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","name":"Lace Padilla"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wenxuxmn@gmail.com","name":"Wen Xu"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"wenxuxmn@gmail.com","name":"Wen Xu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"cdeb2b03-68fd-4816-8611-544145e35ba2","keywords":["Visualization","cognition","graphical convention","conceptual metaphor","connected scatterplot"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/k45es/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1602-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTYwMi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.XRlPRT1Uq5QO46PYJQykXSZe_XNOhyvCejR_pJcA3HE","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1602-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=5fa3758024a7d7d4a449db6344f40dc8c571a388912c984e5df28d756f5ec5a7","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1602-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=21b08df85ca78026e1b1c10df6f0465ee105a5a925e2871bf0440ac44c83eb69","practitioners_statement":"This paper will be of interest for data journalists in particular.

However, due to the complex domain knowledge and contextual information involved in tactical visualizations, it is challenging for users to connect high-level tactical insights to corresponding visual patterns. This requires users to engage in a reasoning process to interpret insights within game contexts, which remains insufficiently supported in existing visual-text linking studies. In this work, we propose InsightChaser, a novel approach to bridge tactical insights and soccer visualizations through visual-text linking and visual reasoning enhancement. InsightChaser constructs knowledge graphs to represent both visual elements and contextual game information. Integrating large language models (LLMs), our approach retrieves relevant visual elements and establishes explicit links with insights. Moreover, InsightChaser utilizes LLMs to enhance these visual-text links by providing reasoning explanations and visual effects.

To date, labeled chart pairs have been drawn from published empirical research results; however, such pairs are not comprehensive, resulting in a training corpus that lacks many design variants and fails to systematically assess potential trade-offs. To improve knowledge base coverage and accuracy, we contribute data augmentation techniques for generating and labeling chart pairs. We present methods to generate novel chart pairs based on design permutations and by identifying under-assessed features\u2014leading to an expanded corpus with thousands of new chart pairs, now in need of labels. Accordingly, we next compare varied methods to scale labeling efforts to annotate chart pairs, in order to learn updated feature weights.

However, traditional visual interfaces often rely on specialized graphical representations and interactions, which require additional effort to learn and use. Natural language interaction offers a more intuitive alternative, but teaching machines to recognize diverse scientific concepts and extract corresponding structures from flow data poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that aligns flow pattern representations with the semantic space of large language models (LLMs), eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our approach encodes streamline segments using a denoising autoencoder and maps the generated flow pattern representations to LLM embeddings via a projector layer. This alignment empowers semantic matching between textual embeddings and flow representations through an attention mechanism, enabling the extraction of corresponding flow patterns based on textual descriptions. To enhance accessibility, we develop an interactive interface that allows users to query and visualize flow structures using natural language. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling intuitive and intelligent flow exploration.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"zhangwh79@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Weihan Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"taoj23@mail.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Jun Tao"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"zhangwh79@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Weihan Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"taoj23@mail.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Jun Tao"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zhangwh79@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Weihan Zhang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"zhangwh79@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Weihan Zhang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"d207baab-2afc-4d7a-bbfd-cf81768ec83c","keywords":["Flow visualization","natural language","streamlines"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1349-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTM0OS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDF9.d7dYMhp-Uu-tkqZQ1ig5gA93c_Q0FNir7YOBF4qaong","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1349-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=39129b8f44dda8bde5c9240398271dc910605b8eca7d005253f2a929a5a1656a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1349-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=de3cc4c4533225c2312bb3eff3f03cf595fe24e78311f42d1fe2fc244478d6c9","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners such as scientific data visualization researchers, tool developers, and domain scientists working with flow data would be interested in this paper.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06300","program_paper_id":"1349","title":"Automatic Semantic Alignment of Flow Pattern Representations for Exploration with Large Language Models","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Traditional volume visualization (VolVis) methods, like direct volume rendering, suffer from rigid transfer function designs and high computational costs.

However, current VR broadcast systems often lack an effective camera language and do not adequately incorporate dynamic, in-game visualizations, limiting viewer engagement and narrative clarity. To address these limitations, we analyze 400 out-of-play segments from eight major tennis broadcasts to develop a tennis-specific design framework that effectively combines cinematic camera movements with embedded visualizations. We further refine our framework by examining 25 cinematic VR animations, comparing their camera techniques with traditional tennis broadcasts to identify key differences and inform adaptations for VR. Based on data extracted from the broadcast videos, we reconstruct a simulated game that captures the players' and ball's motion and trajectories. Leveraging this design framework and processing pipeline, we develope Beyond the Broadcast, a VR tennis viewing system that integrates embedded visualizations with adaptive camera motions to construct a comprehensive and engaging narrative. Our system dynamically overlays tactical information and key match events onto the simulated environment, enhancing viewer comprehension and narrative engagement while ensuring perceptual immersion and viewing comfort. A user study involving tennis viewers demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional VR broadcasting methods in delivering an immersive, informative viewing experience.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"peter650059@hotmail.com","name":"Jun-Hsiang Yao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"23110980031@m.fudan.edu.cn","name":"Jielin Feng"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"xinfangtian0206@163.com","name":"Xinfang Tian"},{"affiliation":"University of Nottingham","email":"kai.xu@nottingham.ac.uk","name":"Kai Xu"},{"affiliation":"Al-Farabi Kazakh National University","email":"gulshat.aa@gmail.com","name":"Gulshat Amirkhanova"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"peter650059@hotmail.com","name":"Jun-Hsiang Yao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"23110980031@m.fudan.edu.cn","name":"Jielin Feng"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"xinfangtian0206@163.com","name":"Xinfang Tian"},{"affiliation":"University of Nottingham","email":"kai.xu@nottingham.ac.uk","name":"Kai Xu"},{"affiliation":"Al-Farabi Kazakh National University","email":"gulshat.aa@gmail.com","name":"Gulshat Amirkhanova"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"peter650059@hotmail.com","name":"Jun-Hsiang Yao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"peter650059@hotmail.com","name":"Jun-Hsiang Yao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"d2d68e75-88a1-4f4a-a1c5-7d8cb6706524","keywords":["Tennis","VR Broadcasting","Embedded Visualization","Camera Motion","Immersive Experience"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1732-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTczMi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.PXNtMYtKHjqSYOYZg3IqeoOVL4fcc3XyzmecM7z0tX8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1732-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=3c55238574155e8b3a922549bef2f925e62f24270015673b2f640056b1ccedf3","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1732-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=15d76c8598b00f373f5900e204f79a2f173d9801009cc7f0b5fb27d184869807","practitioners_statement":"Target Practitioners:\nSports Broadcasting Professionals, VR/AR Developers, Sports Data Visualization Specialists. \n\nPractitioners can apply this research to:\nDesign Immersive VR Broadcasts, Optimize Viewer Engagement, Streamline Production Pipelines.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20006","program_paper_id":"1732","title":"Beyond the Broadcast: Enhancing VR Tennis Broadcasting through Embedded Visualizations and Camera Techniques","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"3D scene stylization refers to generating stylized images of the scene at arbitrary novel view angles following a given set of style images while ensuring consistency when rendered from different views. Recently, several 3D style transfer methods leveraging the scene reconstruction capabilities of pre-trained neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been proposed. To successfully stylize a scene this way, one must first reconstruct a photo-realistic radiance field from collected images of the scene. However, when only sparse input views are available, pre-trained few-shot NeRFs often suffer from high-frequency artifacts, which are generated as a by-product of high-frequency details for improving reconstruction quality. Is it possible to generate more faithful stylized scenes from sparse inputs by directly optimizing encoding-based scene representation with target style? In this paper, we consider the stylization of sparse-view scenes in terms of disentangling content semantics and style textures. We propose a coarse-to-fine sparse-view scene stylization framework, where a novel hierarchical encoding-based neural representation is designed to generate high-quality stylized scenes directly from implicit scene representations. We also propose a new optimization strategy with content strength annealing to achieve realistic stylization and better content preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve high-quality stylization of sparse-view scenes and outperforms fine-tuning-based baselines in terms of stylization quality and efficiency.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Yifan Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Ang Gao"},{"email":null,"name":"Yi Gong"},{"email":null,"name":"Yuan Zeng"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Yifan Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Ang Gao"},{"email":null,"name":"Yi Gong"},{"email":null,"name":"Yuan Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"12441002@mail.sustech.edu.cn","name":"Yifan Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"12441002@mail.sustech.edu.cn","name":"Yifan Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.695102+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3558468","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"d2fa4c75-569f-476f-bac2-2595391bea61","keywords":["Three-dimensional displays","Neural radiance field","Geometry","Image reconstruction","Rendering (computer graphics)","Optimization","Semantics","Visualization","Training","Encoding"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Computer vision and graphics researchers.

We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot, which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees, and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision trees.

However, the optimization process can span days or even weeks due to its reliance on coordinate-based inputs and outputs for modeling volumetric data. To address this issue, we introduce a divide-and-conquer INR (DCINR), significantly accelerating the compressing process of time-varying volumetric data in hours. Our approach starts by dividing the data set into a set of non-overlapping blocks. Then, we apply a block selection strategy to weed out redundant blocks to reduce the computation cost without sacrificing performance. In parallel, each selected block is modeled by a tiny INR, with the size of the INR being adapted to match the information richness in the block. The block size is determined by maximizing the average network capacity. After optimization, the optimized INRs are utilized to decompress the data set. By evaluating our approach across various time-varying volumetric data sets, DCINR surpasses learning-based and lossy compression approaches in compression ratio, visual fidelity, and various performance metrics. Additionally, this method operates within a comparable compression time to that of lossy compressors, achieves extreme compression ratios ranging from thousands to tens of thousands, and preserves features with high quality.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Jun Han"},{"email":null,"name":"Fan Yang"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Jun Han"},{"email":null,"name":"Fan Yang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hanjun@ust.hk","name":"Jun Han"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"hanjun@ust.hk","name":"Jun Han"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.642805+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3564255","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"d916cf6d-cda6-481e-b404-40f8fb053501","keywords":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Training","Data models","Optimization","Data compression","Image coding","Data visualization","Partitioning algorithms","Graphics processing units","Entropy"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"data scientists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3564255","title":"DCINR: a Divide-and-Conquer Implicit Neural Representation for Compressing Time-Varying Volumetric Data in Hours","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We present an authoring tool, called CAST+ (Canis Studio Plus), that enables the interactive creation of chart animations through the direct manipulation of keyframes.

Building on Canis (Ge et al. 2020), a declarative chart animation grammar that leverages data-enriched SVG charts, CAST+ supports auto-completion for constructing both keyframes and keyframe sequences. It also enables users to refine the animation specification (e.g., aligning keyframes across tracks to play them together, adjusting delay) with direct manipulation. We report a user study conducted to assess the visual specification and system usability with its initial version. We enhanced the system's expressiveness and usability: CAST+ now supports the animation of multiple types of visual marks in the same keyframe group with new auto-completion algorithms based on generalized selection. This enables the creation of more expressive animations, while reducing the number of interactions needed to create comparable animations. We present a gallery of examples and four usage scenarios to demonstrate the expressiveness of CAST+.

However, manual analysis of unstructured and unlabeled textual records of debating is time-consuming and ineffective, as it is challenging to reconstruct contextual semantics and track logical connections from raw data. To address this, we propose Conch, an interactive visualization system that systematically analyzes both what is debated and how it is debated. In particular, we propose a novel parallel spiral visualization that compactly traces the multidimensional evolution of clash points and participant interactions throughout debate process. In addition, we leverage large language models with well-designed prompts to automatically identify critical debate elements such as clash points, disagreements, viewpoints, and strategies, enabling participants to understand the debate context comprehensively. Finally, through two case studies on real-world debates and a carefully-designed user study, we demonstrate Conch's effectiveness and usability for competitive debate analysis.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"qianhechen01@gmail.com","name":"Qianhe Chen"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"sakaaanayu@gmail.com","name":"Yixin Yu"},{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"addinistrator.fallindepart@gmail.com","name":"Xiyuan Zhu"},{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"2874849065@qq.com","name":"Xuerou Yu"},{"affiliation":"School of Journalism and Information Communication, Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"rex_wang@hust.edu.cn","name":"Ran Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"qianhechen01@gmail.com","name":"Qianhe Chen"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"sakaaanayu@gmail.com","name":"Yixin Yu"},{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"addinistrator.fallindepart@gmail.com","name":"Xiyuan Zhu"},{"affiliation":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"2874849065@qq.com","name":"Xuerou Yu"},{"affiliation":"School of Journalism and Information Communication, Huazhong University of Science and Technology","email":"rex_wang@hust.edu.cn","name":"Ran Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"qianhechen01@gmail.com","name":"Qianhe Chen"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"qianhechen01@gmail.com","name":"Qianhe Chen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"da138859-6a6c-4df2-813b-6a70e20d04a1","keywords":["Competitive debate","debate analysis","clash point","visual analytics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"Our work introduces Conch, an interactive system that analyzes competitive debates through a novel spiral visualization and a hierarchical semantic framework.

Our results suggest that visualization may have a significant role to play in AI-enabled data analysis workflows. As AI tools become increasingly ubiquitous and sometimes autonomous, anyone interested in getting the most out of them might be curious about the importance of visual input in facilitating model data understanding. \n\nIndeed, we hope the visualization community, including scientists, designers, and developers, take interest in visualization for AI as a new and impactful design space. Our research, while preliminary, may lead to practical changes in the ways we present quantitative information to AI models across knowledge domains.\n\nPractitioners, especially when conducting exploratory data analysis, could take away trying both scenarios: (1) inputting full datasets into a model (even a couple hundred points) with a simple visualization, and (2) just the visualization itself as a starting point to understand salient dataset characteristics. Both scenarios may result in helpful analysis, but our results suggest the first may include convenient statistical data analysis, and the second a concise summary of standout features. This quick, accessible workflow could help any data analyst collaborate more effectively with AI systems.\n\nPractitioners would also learn how easily AIs may be silently tripped up by inconsistent data and visualization inputs. They might begin exercising more caution when conducting exploratory data and visual analysis with an AI, which may not realize or mention potential discrepancies in its inputs.\n\nFinally, practitioners may also be excited about how visualization design may evolve in the future. If the VIS community builds on our work to design charts or graphs that more effectively elicit insights from models, AI-enabled workflows could become more powerful and efficient, allowing humans and AI to jointly tackle more complex empirical questions. Overall, our results lay groundwork for both immediate and future implications for practitioners in a world with increasingly powerful AI systems.","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1345","title":"Does visualization help AI understand data?","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"This research discusses the figurative tensions that arise when using portraits to represent individuals behind a dataset.

Conversely, poorly designed visualizations can impede comprehension, introduce interpretive bias, and diminish the perceived credibility of the conveyed message. This paper investigates the extent to which visual embellishments influence perceived message credibility in data visualizations. We conducted two crowdsourced experiments to examine both holistic and component-level effects of embellishment. In the first experiment, participants evaluated the relative credibility of plain bar charts versus two embellished variants\u2014cartoon-style and image-style\u2014across topics. Participants provided both comparative judgments and qualitative feedback. In the second experiment, we systematically isolated the influence of specific design elements\u2014color, font, and bar style\u2014on credibility perceptions through controlled variations. Our findings reveal that the impact of embellishments on perceived message credibility is complex and context-dependent. While certain embellishments, such as the use of color and image style bars, enhanced credibility, others\u2014most notably hand-drawn fonts and cartoon-style bars\u2014significantly undermined it. By operationalizing trust through the lens of message credibility, this work offers empirical insight into the design factors that shape viewers' perceptions. We conclude by proposing actionable design guidelines to support the creation of visualizations that are effective for communication and credible.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"hsong300@gatech.edu","name":"Hayeong Song"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"aeree@gatech.edu","name":"Aeree Cho"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"john.stasko@cc.gatech.edu","name":"John Stasko"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"hsong300@gatech.edu","name":"Hayeong Song"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"aeree@gatech.edu","name":"Aeree Cho"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"john.stasko@cc.gatech.edu","name":"John Stasko"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hsong300@gatech.edu","name":"Hayeong Song"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"hsong300@gatech.edu","name":"Hayeong Song"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"de570d65-b80f-4e25-9d54-88f11281e2c5","keywords":["Data Visualization","Visual Embellishment","Trust","Credibility","Chart Design","Perception"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/ph4b8/files/osfstorage","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1250-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTI1MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.6O5ZpGyaAQKRtIhJYhpg8mdVK0R-5x5rWPgk7buPuhg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1250-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=2a5a2d2e68440d61a6317b0ca2f984607cb75080a64f953a755e0a786f940834","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1250-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=71443078c73a4eeafe6ce161fd91cf7f5eef57f4540e6e48ec2c32c030299ba1","practitioners_statement":"Practitioners involved in data communication, visualization design, and decision support would find this paper especially valuable.

These patterns, or network motifs, can often be detected algorithmically. However, visual inspection remains vital for exploring and discovering patterns. This paper focuses on presenting motifs within BioFabric network visualizations---a unique technique that opens opportunities for research on scaling to larger networks, design variations, and layout algorithms to better expose motifs. Our goal is to show how highlighting motifs can assist users in identifying and interpreting patterns in BioFabric visualizations. To this end, we leverage existing motif simplification techniques. We replace edges with glyphs representing fundamental motifs such as staircases, cliques, paths, and connector nodes. The results of our controlled experiment and usage scenarios demonstrate that motif simplification for BioFabric is useful for detecting and interpreting network patterns. Our participants were faster and more confident using the simplified view without sacrificing accuracy. The efficacy of our current motif simplification approach depends on which extant layout algorithm is used. We hope our promising findings on user performance will motivate future research on layout algorithms tailored to maximizing motif presentation.

Commonly, one global numerical sensitivity value is computed per simulation parameter. However, when considering 3D spatial simulations, the analysis of localized sensitivities in different spatial regions is of importance in many applications. For analyzing the spatial variation of parameter sensitivity, one needs to compute a spatial sensitivity scalar field per simulation parameter. Given n simulation parameters, we obtain multi-field data consisting of n scalar fields when considering all simulation parameters. We propose an interactive visual analytics solution to analyze the multi-field sensitivity data. It supports the investigation of how strongly and in what way individual parameters influence the simulation outcome, in which spatial regions this is happening, and what the interplay of the simulation parameters is. Its central component is an overview visualization of all sensitivity fields that avoids 3D occlusions by linearizing the data using an adapted scheme of data-driven space-filling curves. The spatial sensitivity values are visualized in a combination of a Horizon Graph and a line chart. We validate our approach by applying it to synthetic and real-world ensemble data.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Marina Evers"},{"email":null,"name":"Simon Leistikow"},{"email":null,"name":"Hennes Rave"},{"email":null,"name":"Lars Linsen"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Marina Evers"},{"email":null,"name":"Simon Leistikow"},{"email":null,"name":"Hennes Rave"},{"email":null,"name":"Lars Linsen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"marina.evers@uni-siegen.de","name":"Marina Evers"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"marina.evers@uni-siegen.de","name":"Marina Evers"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.274048+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3433001","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"e201eb31-fc6e-4bc1-8741-5f4ee5f98e1e","keywords":["Sensitivity analysis","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Rendering (computer graphics)","Task analysis","Analytical models","Visual analytics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Simulation scientists","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03817","program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2024-02-0090]","title":"Interactive Visual Analysis of Spatial Sensitivities","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Given the difficulties and inherent problems of data, how do we approach data representations in a decolonial way?

In this process, researchers need to explore a set of synthetic reactions to transform starting molecules into intermediates step by step until the target novel molecule is obtained. However, designing synthetic routes presents challenges for researchers. First, researchers need to make decisions among numerous possible synthetic reactions at each step, considering various criteria (e.g., yield, experimental duration, and the count of experimental steps) to construct the synthetic route. Second, they must consider the potential impact of one choice at each step on the overall synthetic route. To address these challenges, we proposed SynthLens, a visual analytics system to facilitate the iterative construction of synthetic routes by exploring multiple possibilities for synthetic reactions at each step of construction. Specifically, we have introduced a tree-form visualization in SynthLensto compare and evaluate all the explored routes at various exploration steps, considering both the exploration step and multiple criteria.

A comprehensive collection of matrices, along with a scoring method for measuring the quality of visual patterns in these matrices, contributes to building a benchmark. This benchmark is essential for selecting or designing suitable reordering algorithms for revealing specific patterns. In this paper, we build a matrix-reordering benchmark, ReorderBench, with the goal of evaluating and improving matrix-reordering techniques. This is achieved by generating a large set of representative and diverse matrices and scoring these matrices with a convolution- and entropy-based method. Our benchmark contains 2,835,000 binary matrices and 5,670,000 continuous matrices, each generated to exhibit one of four visual patterns: block, off-diagonal block, star, or band, along with 450 real-world matrices featuring hybrid visual patterns. We demonstrate the usefulness of ReorderBench through three main applications in matrix reordering: 1) evaluating different reordering algorithms, 2) creating a unified scoring model to measure the visual patterns in any matrix, and 3) developing a deep learning model for matrix reordering.","accessible_pdf":"No","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Jiangning Zhu"},{"email":null,"name":"Zheng Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Zhiyang Shen"},{"email":null,"name":"Lai Wei"},{"email":null,"name":"Fengyuan Tian"},{"email":null,"name":"Mengchen Liu"},{"email":null,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Jiangning Zhu"},{"email":null,"name":"Zheng Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Zhiyang Shen"},{"email":null,"name":"Lai Wei"},{"email":null,"name":"Fengyuan Tian"},{"email":null,"name":"Mengchen Liu"},{"email":null,"name":"Shixia Liu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wangz24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","name":"Zheng Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"wangz24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","name":"Zheng Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.54128+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3560345","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"e5d145d6-1bb2-45a6-9333-b5123f205c08","keywords":["Visualization","Measurement","Benchmark testing","Heuristic algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Stars","Symmetric matrices","Indexes","Deep learning","Training"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Visualization researcher, data analyst.

The technique is based on a formal vocabulary of chart representations and rules for merging multiple charts of different types and data into single composite representations. The drillboard hierarchy is created by iteratively applying these rules starting from a baseline dashboard, with each consecutive operation yielding a new dashboard with fewer charts and progressively more abstract and simplified views.

However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works, VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models, facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The utility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative evaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"wanghc1999@gmail.com","name":"Huanchen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"zhangwc2024@mail.sustech.edu","name":"Wencheng Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"wangzq_2021@outlook.com","name":"Zhiqiang Wang"},{"affiliation":"George Mason University","email":"zlu6@gmu.edu","name":"Zhicong Lu"},{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"mayx@sustech.edu.cn","name":"Yuxin Ma"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"wanghc1999@gmail.com","name":"Huanchen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"zhangwc2024@mail.sustech.edu","name":"Wencheng Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"wangzq_2021@outlook.com","name":"Zhiqiang Wang"},{"affiliation":"George Mason University","email":"zlu6@gmu.edu","name":"Zhicong Lu"},{"affiliation":"Southern University of Science and Technology","email":"mayx@sustech.edu.cn","name":"Yuxin Ma"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wanghc1999@gmail.com","name":"Huanchen Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"wanghc1999@gmail.com","name":"Huanchen Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"e8ed00a7-2d3b-46b8-9edd-6853dd9c2f8c","keywords":["Visual analytics","multi-modal model","corruption robustness","image captioning"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1416-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQxNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDJ9.XzGo4WkjVuHu6RCZrkWlt1Gdsoer8uDJi0VPjCJ2Fgw","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1416-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=6f8fe7d2decaad3daa5373abfdaa7dfd69392c57e67966a0c9948082c682aa4f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1416-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=cbae3335cd6e53439f1f8af454d7bdccce12be9aa3fcde409286e6e0d54ec177","practitioners_statement":"Data Scientists in Multi-Modal Model: Use the framework to evaluate the effects of various corruption types, uncover data patterns, and guide augmentation strategies to enhance the robustness of existing vision-language models;\nMachine Learning Researchers: Leverage the multi-level analysis capabilities of the framework to diagnose performance issues and refine models for deployment in real-world applications, ensuring resilience to corrupted or shifted data;\nHCI Specialists: Explore the design principles of the framework to create user-centric tools that facilitate intuitive understanding of model behavior, empowering practitioners to make data-driven decisions.","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1416","title":"VisMoDAl: Visual Analytics for Evaluating and Improving Corruption Robustness of Vision-Language Models","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Biomedical data harmonization is essential for enabling exploratory analyses and meta-studies, but the process of schema matching\u2014identifying semantic correspondences between elements of disparate datasets (schemas)\u2014remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.

BDIViz employs an ensemble approach that combines multiple matching methods with LLM-based validation, summarizes matches through interactive heatmaps, and provides coordinated views that enable users to quickly compare attributes and their values. Our method-agnostic design allows the system to integrate various schema matching algorithms and adapt to application-specific needs. Through two biomedical case studies and a within-subject user study with  domain experts, we demonstrate that BDIViz significantly improves matching accuracy while reducing cognitive load and curation time compared to baseline approaches.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"eden.wu@nyu.edu","name":"Eden Wu"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"d.turakhia@nyu.edu","name":"Dishita Turakhia"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"guandewu@nyu.edu","name":"Guande Wu"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"christos.koutras@nyu.edu","name":"Christos Koutras"},{"affiliation":"New York University School of Medicine","email":"sarah.keegan@nyulangone.org","name":"Sarah Keegan"},{"affiliation":"New York University School of Medicine","email":"wenke.liu@nyulangone.org","name":"Wenke Liu"},{"affiliation":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine","email":"beata.szeitz@nyulangone.org","name":"Beata Szeitz"},{"affiliation":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine","email":"david.fenyo@nyulangone.org","name":"David Fenyo"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"csilva@nyu.edu","name":"Claudio Silva"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"juliana.freire@nyu.edu","name":"Juliana Freire"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"eden.wu@nyu.edu","name":"Eden Wu"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"d.turakhia@nyu.edu","name":"Dishita Turakhia"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"guandewu@nyu.edu","name":"Guande Wu"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"christos.koutras@nyu.edu","name":"Christos Koutras"},{"affiliation":"New York University School of Medicine","email":"sarah.keegan@nyulangone.org","name":"Sarah Keegan"},{"affiliation":"New York University School of Medicine","email":"wenke.liu@nyulangone.org","name":"Wenke Liu"},{"affiliation":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine","email":"beata.szeitz@nyulangone.org","name":"Beata Szeitz"},{"affiliation":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine","email":"david.fenyo@nyulangone.org","name":"David Fenyo"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"csilva@nyu.edu","name":"Claudio Silva"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"juliana.freire@nyu.edu","name":"Juliana Freire"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"eden.wu@nyu.edu","name":"Eden Wu"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"eden.wu@nyu.edu","name":"Eden Wu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"e8f720e9-fa87-43c1-9d57-b8cc150f3cd3","keywords":["Schema matching","Biomedical data harmonization","Data visualization","User-in-the-loop","LLM-based schema matching"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-viz","open_access_supplemental_question":"Our work provides a reproducible pipeline, including thoroughly documented source code, public Docker images for streamlined deployment, and a live server that allows users to directly interact with the system.

However, training a high-quality DNN remains a non-trivial task due to its massive number of parameters. Visualization has shown great potential in addressing this situation, as evidenced by numerous recent visualization works that aid in DNN training and interpretation. These works commonly employ a strategy of logging training-related data and conducting post-hoc analysis. Based on the results of offline analysis, the model can be further trained or fine-tuned. This strategy, however, does not cope with the increasing complexity of DNNs, because (1) the time-series data collected over the training are usually too large to be stored entirely; (2) the huge I/O overhead significantly impacts the training efficiency; (3) post-hoc analysis does not allow rapid human-interventions (e.g., stop training with improper hyper-parameter settings to save computational resources). To address these challenges, we propose an in-situ visualization and analysis framework for the training of DNNs. Specifically, we employ feature extraction algorithms to reduce the size of training-related data in-situ and use the reduced data for real-time visual analytics. The states of model training are disclosed to model designers in real-time, enabling human interventions on demand to steer the training. Through concrete case studies, we demonstrate how our in-situ framework helps deep learning experts optimize DNNs and improve their analysis efficiency.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Guan Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Junpeng Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Yang Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Guihua Shan"},{"email":null,"name":"Ying Zhao"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Guan Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Junpeng Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Yang Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Guihua Shan"},{"email":null,"name":"Ying Zhao"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"liguan@sccas.cn","name":"Guan Li"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"liguan@sccas.cn","name":"Guan Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.370804+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3339585","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"eabf678a-dc8f-4794-9da1-3c30f6b26896","keywords":["Data visualization","Training","Data models","Analytical models","Feature extraction","Artificial neural networks","Computational modeling"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"Our work introduces a novel in-situ visualization framework that performs real-time feature extraction and visual analytics during DNN training.","pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"data scientists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2023.3339585]","title":"An In-Situ Visual Analytics Framework for Deep Neural Networks","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive view synthesis results by learning an implicit volumetric representation from multi-view images. To project the implicit representation into an image, NeRF employs volume rendering that approximates the continuous integrals of rays as an accumulation of the colors and densities of the sampled points. Although this approximation enables efficient rendering, it ignores the direction information in point intervals, resulting in ambiguous features and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a learning method that utilizes learnable view-dependent features to improve scene representation and reconstruction. We model the volume rendering integral with a piecewise constant volume density and spherical harmonic-guided view-dependent features, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the rendering efficiency. In addition, we introduce a regularization term that restricts the anisotropic representation effect to be local, with negligible effect on geometry representations, and that encourages recovering the correct geometry. Our method is flexible and can be plugged into NeRF-based frameworks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representation can boost the rendering quality of various NeRFs and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on both synthetic and real-world scenes.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Yifan Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Xu"},{"email":null,"name":"Yuan Zeng"},{"email":null,"name":"Yi Gong"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Yifan Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Xu"},{"email":null,"name":"Yuan Zeng"},{"email":null,"name":"Yi Gong"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"12441002@mail.sustech.edu.cn","name":"Yifan Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"12441002@mail.sustech.edu.cn","name":"Yifan Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.274048+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3554692","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"eb4ba833-1dae-43a7-bb32-83629a667c08","keywords":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Neural radiance field","Anisotropic","Geometry","Image reconstruction","Solid modeling","Harmonic analysis","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Training","Shape"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"Computer Vision and Graphics Researchers.

However, designing optimal workflows remains challenging due to the expansive design space.

To address these challenges, this work introduces FlowForge, an interactive visualization tool to facilitate multi-agent workflow creation through i) a structured visual explore of the design space and ii) in-situ guidance based on design patterns. Based on formative studies and literature review, FlowForge organizes the workflow design process into three levels (i.e., task planning, agent assignment, and agent optimization), ranging from abstract to concrete. A structured visual exploration of the design space enable users to transition from high-level concepts to detailed implementations, and to compare alternative solutions across multiple performance metrics. Additionally, drawing from established workflow design patterns, FlowForge provides contextually relevant in-situ suggestions at each level as users navigate the design space. Use cases and expert interviews demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of FlowForge, while also yielding valuable observations into how practitioners explore the design space and leverage guidance in workflow creation.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"panzhan1hao@gmail.com","name":"Pan Hao"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"dongyeop@umn.edu","name":"Dongyeop Kang"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities","email":"hinds084@umn.edu","name":"Nicholas Hinds"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"panzhan1hao@gmail.com","name":"Pan Hao"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"dongyeop@umn.edu","name":"Dongyeop Kang"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities","email":"hinds084@umn.edu","name":"Nicholas Hinds"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ed3195e2-8726-4d85-acb7-c5ed2dc361bb","keywords":["LLM workflows","Multi-agent Workflows","design space","hierarchical visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Visual-Intelligence-UMN/FlowForge","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1729-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTcyOS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.y3ksqVhoQI55jk6aNOhgKdYcw58xju9yyeQod7Vpc_Q","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1729-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=545c889242894177b4a09a8a6af3c3c58e31a314439d36982b594a8fd46186d3","practitioners_statement":"AI practitioners interested in designing multi-agent workflows can use this paper to learn how to systematically explore the workflow design space and apply structured guidance to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their workflow creation process.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15559","program_paper_id":"1729","title":"FlowForge: Guiding the Creation of Multi-agent Workflows with Interactive Visualizations as a Thinking Scaffold","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Trajectory data consisting of a low number of smooth parametric curves are standard data sets in visualization.

We introduce trajectory vorticity (TRV), a measure of rotational behavior of a low number of trajectories. We show that it is objective and that it can be introduced in two independent ways: by approaches for unsteadiness minimization and by considering the relative spin tensor. We compare TRV against single-trajectory methods and apply it to a number of constructed and real trajectory data sets, including drifting buoys in the Atlantic, midge swarm tracking data, pedestrian tracking data, pigeon flocks, and a simulated vortex street.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Anke Friederici"},{"email":null,"name":"Holger Theisel"},{"email":null,"name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Anke Friederici"},{"email":null,"name":"Holger Theisel"},{"email":null,"name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:21.695102+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3421555","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"ed5a7810-a23f-4fb7-a81a-9559869613a1","keywords":["Trajectory","Tensors","Rotation measurement","Data visualization","Vectors","Three-dimensional displays","Observers"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"simulation scientists","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2023-09-0596.R1]","title":"Trajectory Vorticity - Computation and Visualization of Rotational Trajectory Behavior in an Objective Way","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Psychomare is an artistic research project that explores the visualization of nightmares through a psychoanalytic and XR-based performance methodology. By treating dreams as symbolic data and nightmares as distortions of subjective recognition, the project translates psychological fear into tangible visual forms. Utilizing AI-driven imagery, embodied dance performance, and virtual production technologies, Psychomare creates an immersive dreamscape where the dancer confronts surreal nightmare entities derived from personal and collective dream memories. Drawing on Lacanian theory, the work proposes that nightmares emerge from a misrecognition of the self\u2014a mirrored distortion of unconscious desires and fears projected onto dream imagery. This symbolic misrecognition becomes the conceptual core of the project, guiding its aesthetic and choreographic strategies. Feedback from the dancer, audience, and a psychoanalyst reveals strong emotional resonance and aesthetic depth, suggesting that the visualization of nightmares can foster self-reflection, emotional confrontation, and collective empathy. This project offers a new model for integrating immersive art, psychoanalytic theory, and technological mediation as a path of collective care.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"jarryyyhuang@gmail.com","name":"Jiayang Huang"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"anijiati587@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Joshua Nijiati Alimujiang"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"kzhangcma@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Kang Zhang"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"daveyip@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"David Yip"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"jarryyyhuang@gmail.com","name":"Jiayang Huang"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"anijiati587@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Joshua Nijiati Alimujiang"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"kzhangcma@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Kang Zhang"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"daveyip@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"David Yip"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jarryyyhuang@gmail.com","name":"Jiayang Huang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"jarryyyhuang@gmail.com","name":"Jiayang Huang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-20T05:17:08.21762+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"a-visap","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"efe038da-ab5b-4531-9235-89a36836d893","keywords":["Nightmares","XR Performance","Psychoanalytic Art Practice","Dream Visualization","Collective Emotion."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/a-visap/1036-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy9hLXZpc2FwLzEwMzYtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDkzOTg1MywiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDc1ODUzfQ.iEo87H9R-45Is0WTuFug0Kuw3aH6n9-7sI5FFE2ii3s","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25h/vis25h-sub1036-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250826%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250826T225317Z&X-Amz-Signature=10d05a72b0247875cfc57ca0dfdfe01949635fd6343f25b6b00a508df11bba21","practitioners_statement":null,"preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1036","title":"Psychomare: A Psychoanalytic and XR-Based Artistic Exploration into Nightmare Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Recent years have witnessed growing interest in understanding the sensitivity of machine learning to training data characteristics. While researchers have claimed the benefits of activities such as a human-in-the-loop approach of interactive label correction for improving model performance, there have been limited studies to quantitatively probe the relationship between the cost of label correction and the associated benefit in model performance. We employ a simulation-based approach to explore the efficacy of label correction under diverse task conditions, namely different datasets, noise properties, and machine learning algorithms. We measure the impact of label correction on model performance under the best-case scenario assumption: perfect correction (perfect human and visual systems), serving as an upper-bound estimation of the benefits derived from visual interactive label correction. The simulation results reveal a trade-off between the label correction effort expended and model performance improvement. Notably, task conditions play a crucial role in shaping the trade-off. Based on the simulation results, we develop a set of recommendations to help practitioners determine conditions under which interactive label correction is an effective mechanism for improving model performance.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Yixuan Wang"},{"email":null,"name":"Jieqiong Zhao"},{"email":null,"name":"Jiayi Hong"},{"email":null,"name":"Ronald G.

Deriving the propagation for time series that can be modeled as a Gaussian process leads to a combination of weighted non-central chi-squared distributions in the spectrum. Percentile-based visualizations explicitly encode the non-normal uncertainty in the 1D Fourier and 2D wavelet spectrum. We enrich the visualization by including correlations, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise analysis.

While prior research has extensively examined the social and collaborative aspects of VA system authoring, the practical challenges of developing these systems remain underexplored. As a result, despite the growing number of VA systems, there are only a few structured knowledge bases to guide their design and development. To tackle this gap, we propose VA-Blueprint, a methodology and knowledge base that systematically reviews and categorizes the fundamental building blocks of urban VA systems, a domain particularly rich and representative due to its intricate data and unique problem sets. Applying this methodology to an initial set of 20 systems, we identify and organize their core components into a multi-level structure, forming an initial knowledge base with a structured blueprint for VA system development. To scale this effort, we leverage a large language model to automate the extraction of these components for other 81 papers (completing a corpus of 101 papers), assessing its effectiveness in scaling knowledge base construction. We evaluate our method through interviews with experts and a quantitative analysis of annotation metrics.

While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing insightful reasoning steps to users.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"zhihaoshuai@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Zhihao Shuai"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"bli303@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Boyan LI"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"syan195@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"siyu yan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"yuyuluo@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Yuyu Luo"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"weikaiyang@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Weikai Yang"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"zhihaoshuai@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Zhihao Shuai"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"bli303@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Boyan LI"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"syan195@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"siyu yan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"yuyuluo@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Yuyu Luo"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"weikaiyang@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Weikai Yang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zhihaoshuai@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Zhihao Shuai"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"zhihaoshuai@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Zhihao Shuai"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f4073f80-c0bd-4d83-9c72-3dcfd060ef7f","keywords":["Data visualization","automatic visualization","large language models"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Bvivib-shuai/DeepVIS","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1818-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTgxOC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.FXCLwdZIclGXTMVWCwenvCot0Ed0G7ZmeUnu46zcPAo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1818-cam-i10.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=0a9c599b66fde5b4b40fcf1ca003268269c7208cc64ef7c1b7b9cd3aa333a430","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1818-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=35ce7375f29d1ca4fd8d429d7afef60a9e50eef97ee29a5d82bb4162c4cb5fe8","practitioners_statement":"Data scientists can use the transparent reasoning as interactive tutorials, showing junior analysts how ambiguous questions are broken down into formal specifications.","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01700","program_paper_id":"1818","title":"DeepVIS: Bridging Natural Language and Data Visualization Through Step-wise Reasoning","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"Immersive visualization of network data enables users to physically navigate and interact with complex structures, but managing transitions between detailed local (egocentric) views and global (exocentric) overviews remains a major challenge.

Making a good schematic transit map is challenging and labour-intensive, and has attracted the attention of the optimization community. Much of the literature has focused on mathematically defining an optimal drawing and algorithms to compute one. However, achieving these optimal layouts is computationally challenging, often requiring multiple minutes of runtime. Crucially, what it means for a map to be good is actually highly dependent on factors that evade a general formal definition, like unique landmarks within the network, the context in which a map will be displayed, and the preference of the designer and client. Rather than attempting to make an algorithm that produces a single high-quality and ready-to-use metro map at great cost, we propose it is more fruitful to support rapid layout iteration by a human designer, providing a workflow that enables efficient exploration of a wider range of designs than could be done by hand, and iterating on these designs. To this end we identify steps in the design process of schematic maps that are tedious to do by hand but are algorithmically feasible, and present a framework around a simple linear program that computes network layouts almost instantaneously given a fixed direction for every connection. These connection directions are decided by a designer in a graphical user interface with several interaction methods and a number of quality-of-life features demonstrating the flexibility of the framework; the implementation is available as open source.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven","email":"tvdmaps@gmail.com","name":"Thomas C. van Dijk"},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven","email":"s.d.terziadis@tue.nl","name":"Soeren Terziadis"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven","email":"tvdmaps@gmail.com","name":"Thomas C. van Dijk"},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven","email":"s.d.terziadis@tue.nl","name":"Soeren Terziadis"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"tvdmaps@gmail.com","name":"Thomas van Dijk"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"tvdmaps@gmail.com","name":"Thomas van Dijk"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f53bf658-7b1b-4417-9c0c-0b74e7455702","keywords":["Geospatial Data","Graph/Network Data","Algorithms","Interaction Design","Software Prototype"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1550-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU1MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.SymWgI0YA4oAXynv49fMOBeIEGLlh7R001UnnUdp9E0","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1550-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=d7e13dc9b343fad4412673a7c54636487cf27b8462bfcefbb5ff1c03f21a3965","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1550-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=eeb79ef6e07e979e5a7f6b9a93eca3f61c5082e285d89475792f916f84691f5c","practitioners_statement":"Graphic designers and information designers might find our tool useful to design schematic layouts of (transit) networks.

However, most of the previous techniques only consider the first-order dependencies among blocks, which is insufficient in describing complex flow patterns. In this work, we present FlowHON, an approach to construct higher-order networks (HONs) from flow fields. FlowHON captures the inherent higher-order dependencies in flow fields as nodes and estimates the transitions among them as edges. We formulate the HON construction as an optimization problem with three linear transformations. The first two layers correspond to the node generation and the third one corresponds to edge estimation. Our formulation allows the node generation and edge estimation to be solved in a unified framework. With FlowHON, the rich set of traditional graph algorithms can be applied without any modification to analyze flow fields, while leveraging the higher-order information to understand the inherent structure and manage flow data for efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowHON using a series of downstream tasks, including estimating the density of particles during tracing, partitioning flow fields for data management, and understanding flow fields using the node-link diagram representation of networks.","accessible_pdf":"Yes","authors":[{"email":null,"name":"Nan Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Zhihong Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Tao"}],"authors_bak":[{"email":null,"name":"Nan Chen"},{"email":null,"name":"Zhihong Li"},{"email":null,"name":"Jun Tao"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"taoj23@mail.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Jun Tao"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"taoj23@mail.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Jun Tao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-25T22:57:20.906116+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2025.3550130","event_prefix":"v-tvcg","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"id":"f663e24c-ffe1-49ff-8c6d-507745448c8a","keywords":["Data visualization","Visualization","Prefetching","Partitioning algorithms","Layout","Estimation","Vectors","Trajectory","Optimization","Feature extraction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":null,"pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":null,"practitioners_statement":"simulation scientist","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02243","program_paper_id":"[TVCG 2024-09-0811]","title":"FlowHON: Representing Flow Fields Using Higher-Order Networks","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We present VolMoVis, a method for dynamic tomographic reconstruction that supports real-time volume generation and volumetric motion visualization from 2D projections. Visualizing the motion of 3D anatomical structures, such as organs and tumors, is critical for computer-aided interventions. However, conventional 4D volumetric reconstruction methods typically produce a limited set of volumes at discrete phases, suffering from low temporal resolution. Moreover, it often requires extensive segmentation of 3D structures or regions for visualizing volumetric data, making it challenging to segment and visualize dynamic volumes in real-time. To address these challenges, VolMoVis framework employs a continuous implicit neural representation that decomposes the dynamic volumetric data into a static reference volume and a continuous deformation field. This decomposition, along with an efficient deformation network, enables our framework to achieve real-time volume generation and volumetric visualization of continuous anatomical motions. We evaluate VolMoVis on both 4D digital phantoms and real patient datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate anatomical reconstruction and motion tracking. Furthermore, we highlight its capabilities in real-time simultaneous volume generation and tumor segmentation for visualizing dynamic volumes and 4D tumor tracking, showcasing its potential in image-guided radiation therapy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"dgaofeng@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Gaofeng Deng"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"ari@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Arie Kaufman"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"dgaofeng@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Gaofeng Deng"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"ari@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Arie Kaufman"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"dgaofeng@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Gaofeng Deng"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"dgaofeng@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Gaofeng Deng"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.549263+00:00","discord_url":"https://discord.com/channels/1422883912660549696/1430945563997638697","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f84ebbf0-98bb-4a65-9640-3161c7449f60","keywords":["Neural Representations","4D Reconstruction","Dynamic Volume Visualization","Real-Time Generation","Volume Rendering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1161-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTE2MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDN9.di_sgq6h8fkFPYnphLave4nk3woBlBfC8cyj-RyxSY4","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1161-cam-i10.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=aab69f5abd5fd42f05f14fa76664124f4a81e7df2cee84f1c7e360f82fef583d","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1161-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=081b019d96f333a6ffc54a68a32155a7dd453d5370c2bf6df525e8ee670dd0d8","practitioners_statement":"This paper will be of interest to medical physicist, radiation oncologists, radiologist, and visualization practitioners working with dynamic anatomical data.

However, analyzing such data is inherently complex and iterative, requiring expertise across multiple domains. The need to manage diverse datasets, distill intricate workflows, and integrate various analytical methods presents a high barrier to entry, especially for researchers and urban experts who lack proficiency in data management, machine learning, and visualization. Advancements in large language models offer a promising solution to lower the barriers to the construction of analytics systems by enabling users to specify intent rather than define precise computational operations. However, this shift from explicit operations to intent-based interaction introduces challenges in ensuring alignment throughout the design and development process. Without proper mechanisms, gaps can emerge between user intent, system behavior, and analytical outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose Urbanite, a framework for human-AI collaboration in urban visual analytics. Urbanite leverages a dataflow-based model that allows users to specify intent at multiple scopes, enabling interactive alignment across the specification, process, and evaluation stages of urban analytics. Based on findings from a survey to uncover challenges, Urbanite incorporates features to facilitate explainability, multi-resolution definition of tasks across dataflows, nodes, and parameters, while supporting the provenance of interactions. We demonstrate Urbanite's effectiveness through usage scenarios created in collaboration with urban experts.

Visualization has the potential to facilitate the mapping and analysis of these complex relationships, but capturing structured information from unstructured story data remains a challenge. As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, we see an opportunity to use their text processing and analysis capabilities to augment and reimagine existing storyline visualization techniques. Toward this goal, we introduce an LLM-driven data parsing pipeline that automatically extracts relevant narrative information from novels and scripts. We then apply this pipeline to create Story Ribbons, an interactive visualization system that helps novice and expert literary analysts explore detailed character and theme trajectories at multiple narrative levels. Through pipeline evaluations and user studies with Story Ribbons on 36 literary works, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to streamline narrative visualization creation and reveal new insights about familiar stories. We also describe current limitations of AI-based systems, and interaction motifs designed to address these issues.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"catherineyeh@g.harvard.edu","name":"Catherine Yeh"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"tarakmenon@gmail.com","name":"Tara Menon"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"aryarobinsingh@gmail.com","name":"Robin Singh Arya"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"hairong.he03@gmail.com","name":"Helen He"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"weigel@fas.harvard.edu","name":"Moira Weigel"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"viegas@google.com","name":"Fernanda Viegas"},{"affiliation":"Harvard","email":"wattenberg@gmail.com","name":"Martin Wattenberg"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"catherineyeh@g.harvard.edu","name":"Catherine Yeh"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"tarakmenon@gmail.com","name":"Tara Menon"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"aryarobinsingh@gmail.com","name":"Robin Singh Arya"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"hairong.he03@gmail.com","name":"Helen He"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"weigel@fas.harvard.edu","name":"Moira Weigel"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"viegas@google.com","name":"Fernanda Viegas"},{"affiliation":"Harvard","email":"wattenberg@gmail.com","name":"Martin Wattenberg"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"catherineyeh@g.harvard.edu","name":"Catherine Yeh"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"catherineyeh@g.harvard.edu","name":"Catherine Yeh"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.549263+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f9fb5a2a-c9bd-48f5-b5be-8a75e1b77b02","keywords":["Narrative visualization","interactive literary analysis","large language models"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1516-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUxNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzR9.ld6p2HDKL-TQmF6-XYJMMaWWXpRnfibZ18egC8H67nI","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1516-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=d355f24c3b5e9748936de36a22418467261a79569a34838b286d6cbcaeb938f8","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1516-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=3cec76b18667d8ddb24c9a46b392700951729d252f9ac73d1e125e4ace52c938","practitioners_statement":"We believe our work would interest many practitioners, such as literary scholars, educators, digital humanitarians, and writers.

We represent the space of reference frame motions in a 3D spatial domain via a 6D parameter space, in which every observer is a time-dependent curve. Our framework supports operations in this 6D observer space by separately focusing on two 3D subspaces, for 3D translations, and 3D rotations, respectively. We show that this approach facilitates a variety of interactions with 3D flow fields.\nBuilding on the interactive selection of observers, we furthermore introduce novel techniques such as observer-aware streamline- and pathline-filtering as well as observer-aware isosurface animations of scalar fluid properties for the enhanced visualization and analysis of 3D unsteady flows.\nWe discuss the theoretical underpinnings as well as practical implementation considerations of our approach, and demonstrate the benefits of its 6+1D observer-based methodology on several 3D unsteady flow datasets.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","email":"xingdi.zhang@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Xingdi Zhang"},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","email":"amani.ageeli@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Amani Ageeli"},{"affiliation":"Thomas Theussl","email":"tom.theussl@gmail.com","name":"Thomas Theu\u00dfl"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"markus.hadwiger@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Markus Hadwiger"},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","email":"peter.rautek@gmail.com","name":"Peter Rautek"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","email":"xingdi.zhang@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Xingdi Zhang"},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","email":"amani.ageeli@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Amani Ageeli"},{"affiliation":"Thomas Theussl","email":"tom.theussl@gmail.com","name":"Thomas Theu\u00dfl"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"markus.hadwiger@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Markus Hadwiger"},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","email":"peter.rautek@gmail.com","name":"Peter Rautek"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"xingdi.zhang@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Xingdi Zhang"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"xingdi.zhang@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Xingdi Zhang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"fb22d5c6-8a2f-4d98-80ec-1fbbfed18538","keywords":["Flow visualization","unsteady flow","reference frame optimization","interactive visualization","coherent structures"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Cindy-xdZhang/PyflowVis","open_access_supplemental_question":"This paper is accompanied by comprehensive supplemental materials and a well-documented open-source implementation.","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1817-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTgxNy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.6O_7_NFXSzj7Yqg93evKZXnSu7xrijuKZM73SoKt53k","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1817-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=df53c702f7a72241be01d995078036b158fd116f89978db34fbad6bc04d68963","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1817-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=b18f15c6cdd33cf3b0d7297b5a30a02f14fa48facb2dc9b03f7f748fdbb42b4f","practitioners_statement":"simulation scientists\nCFD scientists\nphysicist","preprint_link":"https://vccvisualization.org/research/observerspaces/","program_paper_id":"1817","title":"Exploring 3D Unsteady Flow using 6D Observer Space Interactions","updated_at":"2025-10-29T07:30:14.691567+00:00"},{"abstract":"We explore the effects of data and design considerations through the example case of part-to-whole data relationships. Standard part-to-whole representations like pie charts and stacked bar charts make the relationships of parts to the whole explicit. Value estimation in these charts benefits from two perceptual mechanisms: anchoring, where the value is close to a reference value with an easily recognized shape, and alignment where the beginning or end of the shape is aligned with a marker. In an online study, we explore how data and design factors such as value, position, and encoding together impact these effects in making estimations in part-to-whole charts. The results show how salient values and alignment to positions on a scale affect task performance. This demonstrates the need for informed visualization design based around how data properties and design factors affect perceptual mechanisms.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"cbailey9@wisc.edu","name":"Connor Bailey"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"gleicher@cs.wisc.edu","name":"Michael Gleicher"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"cbailey9@wisc.edu","name":"Connor Bailey"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"gleicher@cs.wisc.edu","name":"Michael Gleicher"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"cbailey9@wisc.edu","name":"Connor Bailey"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"cbailey9@wisc.edu","name":"Connor Bailey"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.714397+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"fb8fb932-9800-4cfe-9ad5-4d7504df2c00","keywords":["part-to-whole","estimation","graphical perception","anchoring","alignment","rounding","perceptual mechanisms."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/e36au, https://github.com/uwgraphics/PartToWhole","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1307-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzMDctZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY4fQ.laGAgh5gV49CW0ID6Cp52XRuYWcTLH-FYkhPhs30-Zo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1307-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=e2760331bcd0e6d3c500517c1245340936d1a25d9903022ce3adc7405c7c56e0","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1307-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=4d2887a780cc07cb4b2e1002abacadd81cc1887bd6f545557e72a85a70748a6a","practitioners_statement":"This paper demonstrates the effects of data and design factors on perceptual mechanisms, and the resulting effects on task performance.

We tested three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.7-sonnet, GPT-4.5-preview, and Gemini-2.0-pro) on the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) using standard prompts and our structured approach. The Charts-of-Thought method guides LLMs through a systematic data extraction, verification, and analysis process before answering visualization questions. Our results show Claude-3.7-sonnet achieved a score of 50.17 using this method, far exceeding the human baseline of 28.82. This approach improved performance across all models, with score increases of 21.8% for GPT-4.5, 9.4% for Gemini-2.0, and 13.5% for Claude-3.7 compared to standard prompting. The performance gains were consistent across original and modified VLAT charts, with Claude correctly answering 100% of questions for several chart types that previously challenged LLMs. Our study reveals that modern multimodal LLMs can surpass human performance on visualization literacy tasks when given the proper analytical framework. These findings establish a new benchmark for LLM visualization literacy and demonstrate the importance of structured prompting strategies for complex visual interpretation tasks. Beyond improving LLM visualization literacy, Charts-of-Thought could also enhance the accessibility of visualizations, potentially benefiting individuals with visual impairments or lower visualization literacy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"amitkumar.das@stonybrook.edu","name":"Amit Kumar Das"},{"affiliation":"East West University","email":"md.tarun005@gmail.com","name":"Mohammad Tarun"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"authors_bak":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"amitkumar.das@stonybrook.edu","name":"Amit Kumar Das"},{"affiliation":"East West University","email":"md.tarun005@gmail.com","name":"Mohammad Tarun"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"amitkumar.das@stonybrook.edu","name":"Amit Kumar Das"}],"contributors_bak":[{"email":"amitkumar.das@stonybrook.edu","name":"Amit Kumar Das"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","discord_url":null,"doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"fcafb37e-70f2-4d68-b9a4-e92902d9d2bd","keywords":["Visualization Literacy","Large Language Models","Charts-of-Thoughts","Data Extraction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/vhcailab/Charts-of-Thought","open_access_supplemental_question":"We provide comprehensive supplementary materials including all source code, experimental data, prompts, and detailed results to ensure full reproducibility.

To address these challenges, we propose SimVec, a novel simplified vector format that encodes chart elements such as mark type, position, and size. The effectiveness of SimVec is demonstrated by using MLLMs to reconstruct chart information from SimVec formats. Then, we build a new visualization dataset, SimVecVis, to enhance the performance of MLLMs in visualization understanding, which consists of three key dimensions: bitmap images of charts, their SimVec representations, and corresponding data-centric question-answering (QA) pairs with explanatory chain-of-thought (CoT) descriptions. We finetune state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., MiniCPM and Qwen-VL), using SimVecVis with different dataset dimensions. The experimental results show that it leads to substantial performance improvements of MLLMs with good spatial perception capabilities (e.g., MiniCPM) in data-centric QA tasks.
