This is the Jekyll version of the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org).  

The `master` branch (the page you're currently viewing) is the archived version of the site (years 2018 and earlier).  

To edit files in other years, check the other `vis*` branches.  Click the below links to teleport:
- [vis2020](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/tree/vis2020) - the current 2020 site
- [vis2019](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/tree/vis2019) - the 2019 redesign

## Contributing

If you're contributing content, but not administrating the website itself, you will want to follow the [contributor's guide](instructions.md).

## Building

**Automatic building**: The [.github/workflows/staging.yml](/.github/workflows/staging.yml) file contains a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the site.

**To build locally**, simply run `jekyll serve` from a command line.  You may need to install Ruby (we recommend [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme) and using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) if not on a UNIX-like system), and install the bundler and jekyll gems (`gem install bundler`, `gem install jekyll`).
