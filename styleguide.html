  <p>As the leading academic event on visualization research, <em>IEEE VIS</em> expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. Papers and any supplemental material are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results. During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision.</p>

  <p>Additionally, <em>IEEE VIS 2019</em> will feature a separate, short papers track with a submission deadline of <em><strong>June 13, 2019</strong></em>, after notifications for full papers have been sent out. You can find out more in the call for participation for <a href="">IEEE VIS Short Papers</a>.</p>

  <p>When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the <a href="">paper submission guidelines</a>.</p>

  <p>The three conference tracks at <em>IEEE VIS 2019</em> use the same submission and review process. The conferences differ in the topics, emphasis, and approach, as described in the conference-specific for <a href="">VAST</a>, <a href="">InfoVis</a>, and <a href="">SciVis</a>.</p>

  <p>Authors of accepted papers should also follow the <a href="">instructions for preparing a camera-ready submission</a>.</p>
