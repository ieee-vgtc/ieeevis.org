Welcome to **IEEE VIS 2016**!

After ten years, we are excited to be returning to Baltimore,
Maryland. Located on the mid-Atlantic coast, the city is easy to
reach and has wonderful attractions as part of the Inner Harbor
district near the conference hotel.

The forum will be held October 23-28, 2016, and will include programs
for students, academics, artists, industry and commercial
practitioners, government researchers, and anyone with interests in
visualization and data analytics. 
The conference trend has been to draw over 1,000 participants from
dozens of countries to a week of research presentations, tutorials,
workshops, panels, demonstrations, posters, and exhibitions.

We invite you to participate in **IEEE Visual Analytics Science and
Technology (VAST)**, **IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis)**,
**IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis)**, and art program, along
with the growing array of symposia that share our week. Bring your
imagination, your data, your problems, your solutions, your research,
insights, experience, and enthusiasm.

**VIS 2016 General Chair**  
Terry Yoo, *National Institutes of Health*
