## <a name="vis-newcomers"></a> VIS Newcomers 

Sunday, OCTOBER 1  
12:20 - 12:45PM  
Location: 106-ABC   

Organizers: Jagoda Walny and Kate Isaacs  
Contact: [community@ieeevis.org](mailto:community@ieeevis.org)  

Attending VIS for the first time can be overwhelming, especially if you don't know any other attendees, it's your first conference, or if you are new to visualization. The VIS Newcomers Meetup is a conference orientation and informal lunch intended for first-time VIS attendees, regardless of experience, from students to practitioners. This allows participants to meet other conference goers and learn various tips for attending VIS. The meetup will start with a short presentation containing conference tips. Following the presentation, meetup attendees will split into small groups led by experienced VIS attendees to continue discussions over lunch and get to know each other. 

NOTE: Lunch is not prepaid, each meetup attendee pays for their own lunch. 

For more activities outside of the Newcomers Meetup, or if you are unable to attend the meetup, please see Vis Buddies, a [Community](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/call-participation/community) program bringing together groups of new and old VIS attendees for additional activities outside of this meetup.

## <a name="career-women"></a> Career Plans for Women 

Sunday, OCTOBER 1  
2:00PM - 4:00PM  
Location: 103-B   

Organizers: Alexandra Diehl and Johanna Schmidt   
Contact: [diehl@dbvis.inf.uni-konstanz.de](mailto:diehl@dbvis.inf.uni-konstanz.de)   

This Meetup is a natural follow up of the [AVID: Advancing Visualization Inclusion and Diversity workshop](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/workshops#avid). The goal of the Meetup session is to discuss possible career paths of women in the field of Visualization and Visual Analytics. Successful female researchers will share their career experience and highlight guidelines and lessons learned. The participants will get to know successful female role models in their field of research which will be a great opportunity to learn from their experience. The Meetup session should inspire female Ph.D. students to work in our research area and, due to the availability of travel support from the strategic research on "Quantitative Methods for Visual Computing” (SFB-TRR 161, http://www.sfbtrr161.de/) funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), more female Ph.D. and Master students will be able to attend the VisWeek conference.

We will provide DATA, BIB, Food, and Drinks!
No matter which [gender](https://www.quora.com/Scientifically-how-many-sexes-genders-are-there) you are :-)
Come and join us!

## <a name="decisive"></a> DECISIVe 2017: Dealing with Cognitive Biases in Visualisations

Monday, OCTOBER 2  
2:00PM - 5:30PM  
Location: 103-A   


Organizers: Geoff Ellis, Evanthia Dimara, Donald Kretz and Alex Endert
Contact: [ellis@dbvis.inf.uni-konstanz.de](mailto:ellis@dbvis.inf.uni-konstanz.de)

This meetup is a continuation of the [DECISIVe workshop](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/workshops) from the morning, in which 14 papers on cognitive biases and decision making were presented. In this afternoon session, we will have a series of group activities where we will explore some of the interesting issues raise in the morning such as classification, identification and mitigation of cognitive biases, all in the context of information and visual analytic systems. We will also have a problem-solving session which was a highlight of the 1st DECISIVe workshop in 2014.

The meetup also welcomes participants who could not attend the morning workshop but have an interest or experience in the area or just want to find out more of how our innate decision making system can give rise to poor judgements, without us being aware!

DECISIVe website: [http://decisive-workshop.dbvis.de/](http://decisive-workshop.dbvis.de/)


This Meetup is a follow up of the DECISIVe Workshop, where we will continue the discussions initiated during the workshop and pursue group activities. The Meetup is also a chance for additional attendees who aren't able to come to the Workshop to partake in the discussions.

## <a name="junior-faculty"></a> Junior Faculty, Researchers, and Practitioners Happy Hour

Tuesday, OCTOBER 3  
6:00PM - 8:00PM  
Location: 103-A   

Organizers: Kristi Potter and Remco Chang   
Contact: [kristi.potter@nrel.gov](mailto:kristi.potter@nrel.gov)   

Join your fellow junior-level faculty, researchers, and practitioners in our first ever happy hour!

The goal of this meetup is to provide a safe environment for junior Vis researchers to gather and discuss challenges faced in and out of the work environment. The VIS community has always been very supportive of its junior members, however, one missing link among these wide range of programs is support for the junior professors, early career researchers and practitioners.  Junior researchers face significant amount of pressure and are often overwhelmed by the drastic change from being a student (or a postdoc). Many junior researchers have little training in project management, grant-writing, mentoring, teaching, and establishing a research agenda. As a result, they struggle maintaining a work-life balance and have few (if no) outlet in seeking help, advice, or support. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet fellow early career researchers, participate in peer mentoring, and as a result build a social network (or a cohort) that will continue to support beyond the VIS conference.

## <a name="sonification"></a> Sonification; augmenting visualization

Tuesday, OCTOBER 3  
6:00PM - 8:00PM  
Location: 103-B   


Organizer: Niklas Rönnberg   
Contact: [niklas.ronnberg@liu.se](mailto:niklas.ronnberg@liu.se)   

The topic for this Meetup is the use of sound to enhance and clarify visual representations of data, and to simplify the understanding of these. Within the sonification research community there is a consensus that sonification is useful, but discussions within that community often lack the expertise in other domains such as in information visualization. For example, the mapping between sound and visual elements, i.e. what in the visual representation that is suitable for sonification, needs to be thoroughly explored in connection to different application areas and types of visualization. This meetup discussion will therefore focus on the mapping between sonification and visual elements, and what in visual representations that are challenging for the visual perception. If sonification could be used beneficially in information visualization, this would not only advance the research field of sonification, but also research in information visualization where sonification will add new perspectives to data exploration and understanding of complex visual representations.

## <a name="vislies"></a> VisLies: New and Improved!

Tuesday, OCTOBER 3  
7:00PM - 9:00PM  
Location: 103-A   


Organizer: Georges Grinstein, Bernice Rogowitz, Kenneth Moreland, and Claire Lauer  

Please join us on Tuesday night, October 3, for VisLies. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community. Examples from our own work, from published papers, from news outlets, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and insights that may one day save the world. We will also present results of a contest which asked students to create deceptive visualizations using a variety of datasets.

If you have examples to present at VisLies, please visit our web site: [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org). Or email us at [vislies2017@vislies.org](mailto:vislies2017@vislies.org). Or just show up and say you have something interesting to share. Our twitter hashtag is #VisLies.

## <a name="vision-science"></a> Vision Science at InfoVis

Wednesday, OCTOBER 4  
3:45PM - 5:00PM  
Location: 101-ABC   

Organizers: Madison Elliott, Zoya Bylinskii, Christine Nothelfer, Cindy Xiong and Danielle Albers Szafir   
Contact: [mellio10@psych.ubc.ca](mailto:mellio10@psych.ubc.ca)   

Vision science provides an empirical basis for techniques and design practices in visualization, including what data features people attend to, what statistics they extract, and what they ultimately remember. Visualization provides real world problems for vision scientists to investigate, including color perception, pop-out, and salience. Help us explore and promote this promising research partnership! Come mingle with cognitive psychology and visualization experts active at this intersection, to discuss how the two fields can continue to inspire and collaborate with one another. Apart from the InfoVis panel, [Vision Science Meets Visualization](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/panels#vision-science), this Meetup provides another opportunity for interested attendees to ask questions, share new research ideas, and extend their professional networks. All are welcome, and interested participants can submit an abstract for a 2-3 minute ‘lightning talk’ about their latest work by September 15, 2017. The organizers will select a set of 10-15 talks to be presented during the Meetup.

## <a name="blog"></a> Blogging Meetup (Blogging: How to Start and Keep Telling the World About your Work)

Thursday, OCTOBER 5  
6:00 – 7:00PM  
Location: 201  

Organizers: Robert Kosara and Noeska Smit  
Contact: [rkosara@tableau.com](mailto:rkosara@tableau.com), [noeska.smit@uib.no](mailto:noeska.smit@uib.no)
 
When you look around online, you find a lot of colorful pictures but little reliable information about visualization or visualization research. But what about all the good research work that is going on? What about YOUR work? Let’s talk about how you can tell the world outside of the VIS community about what you do, why it matters, and what excites you about it. We’ll chat about how to start a blog, and how to not let it die after three postings. We’ll also talk about how it bolsters your academic credentials and gets your name out into the world. Come hear from some of the people who have been doing this blogging thing successfully for over a decade, and what they’ve learned in the process.
