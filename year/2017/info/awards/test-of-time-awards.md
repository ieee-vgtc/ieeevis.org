The IEEE VIS Test of Time Award is an accolade given to recognize articles published at previous conferences whose contents are still vibrant and useful today and have had a major impact and influence within and beyond the visualization community.

Papers are selected for each of the three conferences (VAST, InfoVis and SciVis) by Test of Time Awards panels appointed by the conference Steering Committees.

The decisions are based on objective measures such as the numbers of citations, and more subjective ones such as the quality and longevity and influence of ideas, outreach, uptake and effect not only in the research community, but also within application domains and visualization practice.

A full rationale will be provided for each paper at the conference opening, where we hope to encourage researchers to aim to produce work that is forward looking and has transformational potential. We're trying to build on our heritage to establish an ambitious future by making it clear at the outset of the conference opening that we want participants to aspire to be writing papers today that will be relevant in decades to come.

## VAST 2007

**Jigsaw: Supporting Investigative Analysis through Interactive Visualization**
<br/>
Authors: Stasko, J.; Görg, C.; Liu, Z.; Singhal, K.<br>

<!--- Jigsaw is a visual analytics system, developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, for enabling analysts and researchers to explore, analyze, and make sense of document collections. This 2007 VAST paper, co-authored by John Stasko, Carsten Görg, Zhicheng Liu, and Kanupriya Singhal, brought Jigsaw to light for the first time. Since then, the software has been used extensively by investigators, analysts, and researchers in many fields, including visualization, text analysis, journalism, law enforcement, finance, and so on According to Google Scholar, the paper has received over 400 citations. While a number of papers published in IEEE VAST 2007 have made significant impact because of their novel scientific contributions, this VAST paper on Jigsaw stands the test of the time with the highest impact. -->

## InfoVis 1997

**The Structure of the Information Visualization Design Space**
<br/>
Authors: Card, S.K.; Mackinlay, J.D.<br>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636792">https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636792 </a><br>

<!--- A unanimous choice amongst panel members and an enjoyable read, from which each of us learned things we had not thought of recently. Card and Mackinlay introduce a model of the visualization design space that is revealing and helps with description and explanation. It's relevant today and useful to apply this to some of the visualization that has developed in the last couple of decades. Really, the paper is well worth reading again  - please have a look.
The work has had a big influence on future papers - and is in effect an early characterization of the kind of work that many of us have attempted since.
Other papers that describe processes and areas of influence followed the lead of this seminal piece of work that mapped the design space explicitly, described and differentiated idioms and dealt with geographic coordinates specifically.
Card and Mackinlay really helped the community understand what visualization was all about and their paper and approach have had lasting effect.
As we said, the notation can be usefully applied to current visualization techniques to describe them, compare them and give us traction as we begin to explain why particular locations in the visualization design space may be appropriate in certain contexts. -->

## InfoVis 2007

**ManyEyes: a Site for Visualization at Internet Scale**
<br/>
Authors: Wattenberg, M.; Viegas, F.B.; van Ham, F.; McKeon, M.; Kriss, J.<br>

<!--- The ManyEyes project, which this paper describes, has been impactful in many ways. The most straight forward are its citations, 671 in total, 48 at VIS. The ToT 2007 committee was unanimous in its decision. We think that beyond the citations this paper has had a huge impact, on the research community, on the information visualization industry, and on the general public. ManyEyes was on the vanguard of the research community starting to think more broadly about what kind of people might make use of an information visualization.  Rather than domain experts, ManyEyes was designed for the general public. People could use the ManyEyes website, upload their own data, choose one of several templates, and create a visualization of their own. This led the research community to think about personal visualizations for individuals’ own data, spurred emphasis on collaborative visualization, and about the importance of visualization on the web. It has had impact industry in that now both Tableau (via Tableau Public) and Microsoft (Via Power BI) have their own data tools for public use. However, we think that the impact on the general population might be most important. This paper had led the ideas about rise of social computing and the importance of data and visualization to people in general – or more specifically, introduced ideas about the democratization of data and visualization. -->
