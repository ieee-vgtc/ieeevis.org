The **IEEE VIS 2017 Poster Program** offers a timely venue to present
and discuss new visualization research through a forum that encourages
graphical presentation, demonstration and active engagement with IEEE
VIS participants.

In addition to a poster being displayed throughout IEEE VIS

* a three-hundred-page summary of your work will be included in the electronic
  conference proceedings (USB memory stick distributed to conference
  attendants)
* interactive poster sessions will provide a forum for presenting your
  work and discussing new ideas with your peers
* video previews
  for posters are strongly suggested
* one presenter per poster will be eligible for the reduced
  conference rate for authors

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to:

* research exploring new problems or areas,
* the results of student or pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known data sets,
* work in progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community, and
* the application of visualization and analytics techniques to
  specific application areas.

We particularly encourage contributions that take advantage of the nature
of the poster space and forum to present and raise awareness of the work
in effective and imaginative ways.

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in the
VGTC conference two-column format in line with the IEEE VIS formatting
guidelines
[http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the
results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion
of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full
literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations
should be included.

The posters themselves have no predefined formatting, but dimensions
may not exceed A0 paper size (841mm x 1189mm / 33.1" x 46.8"). **ONLY
PORTRAIT FORMAT IS ACCEPTABLE**. Poster authors are encouraged to
include a draft or sketch of the poster layout and content in their
submission to help reviewers and show that the poster format is being
used effectively. This sketch should be in PDF format.

Those who intend to show demos are also highly encouraged to submit an
accompanying video or other supplementary materials according to the
IEEE VIS formatting guidelines
[http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/supplement.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/supplement.html).

Authors whose posters are accepted for IEEE VIS will be asked to
refine their posters and summaries based upon feedback from reviewers.

The poster itself only needs to be prepared for and brought to the
poster session at IEEE VIS but should be on display throughout the week.

### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All IEEE VIS poster submissions should be made through a single
submission category on PCS - IEEE VIS Poster.

### IMPORTANT DATES


| Submission Deadline				| **Friday, June 16, 2017**
| Notification of Acceptance			| **Friday, July 21, 2017**

### POSTER SESSION

Authors of accepted posters are required to bring an explanatory hardcopy poster for display during IEEE VIS. They should be available at the poster to discuss their work during the scheduled evening poster session(s).

All authors who plan to show live demos or video should clearly indicate this fact in their submissions. We encourage you to bring a laptop to the poster session where small tables will be provided.

### POSTER REVIEW PROCESS

Each poster submission will be read and evaluated by at least two reviewers.

Submissions will be evaluated according to originality, significance, suitability for the venue (levels of interest, relevance) and the potential for prompting discussion.

All authors will receive reviews of their submission explaining the decision and providing feedback. Authors of posters that are accepted are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER AWARDS

The chairs of each conference will award a 'Best Poster' prize to the authors of what is deemed the strongest submission to the conference according to the reviewing criteria. 'Best Poster' authors will receive a signed certificate.
