**NEWS:** In an effort to better integrate the community in identifying potentially interesting panel topics and people, we conducted a survey to gather the community’s input. If you consider organizing a panel but are not sure yet, please take a look at the results for potential ideas.

Check out the survey results here:

IEEE VIS 2017 Panels should address important and/or controversial applications and issues in visualization and its subfields  today. In particular, we invite topics in connection with interesting application fields. Panels bringing together potential users of visualization technology (e.g. practitioners and industry professionals) and leading researchers, or panels consisting of experts in fields that might teach us **important concepts** (e.g., perceptual psychology, visual design, color theory, user-interface design) are welcome. Panelists should be experts in their fields who can discuss the challenges of visualization, and engage the audience and fellow panel members in a stimulating, interactive debate. Diverging opinions on controversial topics are encouraged.

Panel proposals should describe the topic to be addressed and identify the prospective panelists. Each panelist should include a position statement on the topic and a short biography, the total of which should be limited to 500 words for each panelist, up to a maximum of four pages for the whole panel. In case the panel follows up on the topic of a previously held panel, we ask the organizers to point this out and to detail the advances expected from the follow-up. 

Panels are scheduled for the duration of an entire paper session; panel proposals should thus target **one hour and 40 minutes total duration**, including question and discussion periods. We strongly recommend that in order to keep to time, the chair of the panel is not one of the panel speakers.

Panel organizers should also submit a short description of the panel format and schedule (max. 1 page). This should be in a separate document from the proposal itself, and should describe the order of topics to be discussed, time to be spent on panelist presentations, and mechanisms for encouraging audience participation. Based on audience feedback, the duration of panelist presentations should allow ample time for intra-panel discussion and discussions between the panel and the audience.

Accepted panel organizers are required to prepare a short summary for the printed program (~50 words), as well as a 'Fast Forward' to advertise their panel. They will also be required to submit a Video Preview.

We note that submitting similar topics to multiple venues (e.g., panels and workshops) is likely to result in at most one accepted proposal so that a broad range of topics can be presented at the conference.

Submissions should be emailed as attachments to [panels@ieeevis.org](mailto:panels@ieeevis.org)
