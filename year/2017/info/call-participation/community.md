Our goals in Community are organizing activities at IEEE VIS conference that connect the current and next generation of visualization researchers and practitioners. We do this through providing conference activities to participants for all of the various visualization sub-communities: scientific visualization, information visualization, visual analytics, industry, etc. 

The Community activities are open to all registered IEEE VIS participants, regardless of seniority and affiliation. The activities are organized by the IEEE VIS Community Chairs, who can be reached at [community@ieeevis.org](community@ieeevis.org).

To register or participate in these Community events, please see the corresponding details below.

### <a name="tips"></a> Tips and Tricks for Attending VIS for your First Time

If this is your first time attending VIS, welcome! We have collected
[some advice from those of us who regularly attend VIS that might be
helpful to you](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ot7JHpXcfOMYZuUw0fl4_PghImxHogCrGgPm61CBMx4/edit?usp=sharing).
Furthermore, please consider signing up for Vis Buddies (see below)
and blinging up your badge with a first-time attendee sticker to strike
up conversations with your fellow attendees.

### <a name="years"></a> Years in Attendence and Badge Bling

To spark discussion and connection, we will be providing stickers that allow
you to display how many years you've been at VIS, in addition ones to show this
is your first time at VIS. We will also be providing "bling" to be able to spruce
up your badge, along with your years-in-attendence sticker. These stickers will be 
located near the registration desk, along with the job fair ribbons and a tray to 
collect CVs/resumes for job hunters.

### <a name="job-flyers"></a>Flyer Posting

We will pin up and post job, post-doc, staff, etc. flyers to the VIS 
corkboard if you are unable to attend VISWeek in person. Send your 
flyers to [community@ieeevis.org](mailto:community@ieeevis.org) as a PDF. 
*The deadline to recieve these is a week prior to VIS, otherwise we cannot 
guarantee that it will be posted to the corkboard by the first day of VIS.*

### <a name="visbuddies"></a>Vis Buddies

VisBuddies brings together new and returning VIS attendees with similar interests. For newcomers, this is a chance to meet experienced researchers in the field. For returning attendees, it is a chance to meet fresh talent joining VIS for the first time. You can volunteer for VisBuddies on the registration form (the latest a week prior to VIS). Based on your declared interests in the registration form, we will match pairs or small groups of attendees with different levels of VIS experience, and contact the groups via email prior to VIS.

Suggested Buddies activities include:

* Attend the [VIS Newcomers Meetup](/year/2017/info/meetups#vis-newcomers) together (highly recommended)
* Have lunch, dinner, coffee, etc. with your Buddies at least once
* Discuss interesting sessions to attend
* Introduce your colleagues to your Buddies

Vis Buddies is in conjunction with the Newcomers Meetup [VIS Newcomers Meetup](/year/2017/info/meetups#vis-newcomers). Prior to the Meetup, we will have a booth set-up outside to help you connect with your buddies (if you have not done so already). 

### <a name="ajf"></a>Asynchronous Job Fair

This year, we will be having our first *Asynchronous Job Fair* (AJF) at VIS
2017! The purpose of the *AJF* is to help connect job seekers and researchers
with employers, staff, and faculty over the course of VIS. This includes all
types of job opportunities: staff, industry positions, software engineers,
faculty, post-docs, etc. and all types of job seekers from students to
practitioners. 

The AJF will be continuously held throughout VISWeek concurrently with other 
activities.  The primary activities include: 

- "I’m job hunting!" and "I’m hiring!" badge ribbons available to all attendees. 
By wearing a ribbon, you will be able to find other VIS attendees that are
participating in the *AJF*. These will be located at the registration table. 
- *We strongly suggest carrying either a curriculum vitae (CV), resume, 
business card, or note cards with links, such as LinkedIn or online CVs, to 
help facilitate information exchange during VIS.* 
- CVs will be distributed to [Supporters](/year/2017/info/exhibition/supporters-and-exhibition) 
prior to VIS, to help make connections during VIS, by sharing your information and CVs with the 
supporters. During online registration you will be able to upload your CV and
interests. If you did not upload your CV during online registration, we will
have a collection tray near the *AJF* ribbons at the live registration desk,
and they will be distributed to Supporters after VIS.  
- We will pin up and post job, post-doc, staff, etc. flyers to the VIS 
corkboard if you are unable to attend VIS in person. Send your opportunity 
flyer to [community@ieeevis.org](mailto:community@ieeevis.org) as a PDF. 
The deadline for these is a week prior to VIS, otherwise we cannot guarantee 
that it will be posted to the corkboard by the first day of VIS.  

Please use the *AJF* as an opportunity to strike up a conversation with
your fellow VIS attendees, even if you are not actively seeking employment or
staff!
