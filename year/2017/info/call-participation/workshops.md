We solicit half-day workshops related to all areas of visualization
including visual analytics, information visualization, and scientific visualization. The workshops venue at IEEE VIS provides an informal
setting for participants to discuss advanced technical topics in
visualization, involve experts in the field, disseminate work in
progress, and promote new ideas.

Workshops should:

* emphasize emerging ideas, concepts, or technologies that are
  currently too nascent or too interdisciplinary for a full symposium;
  or
  
* bring together experts on a subject to create a report, white-paper,
  or proposal requiring interactive work sessions that is of potential
  interest to a substantial segment of the visualization community.
  
A distinction that separates workshops from tutorials and symposia is
that the information flow for a workshop should not be directed solely
from the presenters to the audience. Rather, workshops should engage
the participation of all attendees. Workshops at IEEE VIS are open to
all registered attendees and ‘invitation only’ workshops will not be
approved.

Papers submitted and presented as part of workshops will not be
published in the proceedings of the conference. Depending on interest
and actual time schedule of each workshop, it may be possible to
include workshop material on the USB drive for dissemination to venue
attendees.  Workshop organizers should consider publication
strategies, such as publishing their proceedings in IEEE Xplore (see
the list of conference support below) since workshop papers will not
be published in the main conference proceedings. Organizers can
request that workshop materials be included on the USB drive for
dissemination to attendees of the conference.  The camera-ready
deadline for including such materials is August 27, 2017.

Workshop proposals should include:

* a title,
* the contact details of the organizers,
* a brief description of organizers' background, related publications, and research,
* the goals, the technical scope, the mission, and the proposed focus,
* the planned activities,
* the length should be half day; only in special cases will full day workshops be considered,
* a statement of the organization and the development of the list of participants (intended size, detailed selection procedures and timeline for finalizing workshop presenters),
* the requested facilities (room setup as a round table, lecture theater, or in a panel format),
* the intended result and impact of the workshop,
* the number of posters requested, if the workshop intends to publicize posters as part of the main conference poster session, and
* the proposed dates for the call for participation, author notification, and camera-ready deadlines (notification must be prior to the early registration deadline of XXX 2017).

The proposal should not exceed four pages. Please visit
[the formatting guidelines page](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html)
for details and submit [via PCS](http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/).

The workshops will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

* the potential for inspiring people, being influential, and opening new lines of research,
* the ability to attract people and make them excited about the workshop,
* the appropriateness with respect to IEEE VIS topics,
* the qualification of the organizers,
* the coherence of the proposed topic, and
* the feasibility of the proposed plan (financial, time plan, etc.); for a workshop with special needs, please refer to the guidelines below on workshop finances, fundraising, and coordination.

The workshop organizers will receive support from the VIS conference, including:

* one complimentary 1-day registration for an invited speaker,
* room and AV support suitable for up to 100 attendees, and
* complimentary publication of the workshop proceeding in IEEE Xplore with the expectations that:
  * The workshop proceedings are submitted by August 27, 2017.
  * The organizers go through the IEEE Xplore conference application process and obtain approval. Note that this process is usually straightforward since all workshops fall under the main VIS conference budget.

If the requirements of the workshop exceed the support stated above,
the workshop organizers are expected to coordinate with the workshop
chairs and possibly raise funds to support the workshop
activities. Note that it is crucial for the organizers to discuss
fundraising plans with the workshop chairs prior to contacting any
potential funder. For more information about finances and fundraising,
see XXX. 

If the proposed workshop is a follow-up on a previous workshop, please include a discussion of the results and the impact of the previous workshop. The aim of workshops is to include a variety of topics, thus repeat submissions will be judged in part by the success of the previous workshop. Workshop success will be measured subjectively, but popularity, research impact, visibility, and attendee feedback will all be taken into account.

In addition, the workshop chairs will try to balance the proposed topics in order to support the diversity of topics within the IEEE VIS venue and complement the main program of the conference.

Accepted workshops are required to prepare a short summary for the printed program (~50 words).
