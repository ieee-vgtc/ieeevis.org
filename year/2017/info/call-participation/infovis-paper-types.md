---

The IEEE Information Visualization conference ("InfoVis") solicits
research papers on a diverse set of topics related to information
visualization. Broadly defined, information visualization is the
design of visual data representations and interaction techniques that
support human activities where the spatial layout of the visual
representation is not a direct mapping of spatial relationships in the
data. Papers may contribute novel visual encoding or interaction
techniques, evaluations of InfoVis techniques and tools, models or
theories related to InfoVis, systems that support visual data
analysis, or applications of information visualization to
domain-specific problems. None of these guidelines are in any way
prescriptive; in fact, many successful papers combine two contribution
types, and some of the very best papers often combine several.

Please note that topics primarily involving spatial data (such as
scalar, vector and tensor fields) might be a better match for the IEEE
SciVis Conference at IEEE VIS. Similarly, topics that clearly focus on
visual analytics, e.g., computational solutions facilitated by visual
interfaces to support analysis, might be a better match for the IEEE
VAST Conference, also at IEEE VIS. Papers chairs reserve the right to
move papers between conferences based on its topic and perceived fit.

## Paper Types

VIS papers typically fall into one of five categories: technique,
system, design study, evaluation, or model. We briefly discuss these
categories below. Although your main paper type has to be specified
during the paper submission process, papers can include elements of
more than one of these categories; in fact, successful papers
sometimes combine elements from several paper types. Please see
"Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research
Papers" by Tamara Munzner for more detailed discussion on how to write
a successful VIS paper.

The paper types below include several example papers demonstrating
each respective paper type. All of these example papers are selected
from Best Papers or Honorable Mentions at past InfoVis conferences.

### Paper Type: Technique 

Technique papers introduce novel techniques or algorithms that have
not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly
extend known techniques or algorithms, for example by scaling to
datasets of much larger size than before or by generalizing a
technique to a larger class of uses. The technique or algorithm
description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a
competent graduate student in visualization could implement the work,
and the authors should create a prototype implementation of the
methods. Relevant previous work must be referenced, and the advantage
of the new methods over it should be clearly demonstrated. There
should be a discussion of the tasks and datasets for which this new
method is appropriate, as well as its limitations. Evaluation is
likely to strengthen technique papers.

  Selecting and Manipulating Subgraphs in Network Visualizations. IEEE

### Paper Type: System

System papers present a blend of algorithms, technical requirements, user requirements, and design that solves a major problem. The system that is described is both novel and important, and has been implemented. The rationale for significant design decisions is provided, design alternatives and final design choices are discussed, and the system is compared to documented, best-of-breed systems already in use. The comparison includes specific discussion of how the described system differs from and is, in some significant respects, superior to those systems. For example, the described system may offer substantial advancements in the performance or usability of visualization systems, or novel capabilities. Every effort should be made to eliminate external factors (such as advances in processor performance, memory sizes or operating system features) that would affect this comparison.

  Real-Time Exploration of Spatiotemporal Datasets. IEEE Transactions

### Paper Type: Application/Design Study 

Application/Design Study papers explore the choices made when applying
visualization and visual analytics techniques in an application area,
for example relating the visual encodings and interaction techniques
to the requirements of the target task. In addition,
Application/Design Study papers have been the norm when researchers
describe the use of visualization techniques to glean insights from
problems in engineering and science. Although a significant amount of
application domain background information can be useful to provide a
framing context in which to discuss the specifics of the target task,
the primary focus of the case study must be on the use of
visualization in this domain. The results of the Application/Design
Study, including insights generated in the application domain, should
be clearly conveyed. Describing new techniques and algorithms
developed to solve the target problem will strengthen a Design Study
paper, but the requirements for novelty are less stringent than in a
Technique paper. Where necessary, the identification of the underlying
parametric space and its efficient search must be aptly described. The
work will be judged by the design lessons learned or insights gleaned
for visualization research, on which future contributors can build. We
invite submissions on any application area.

  Inter-Attribute Visual Analysis of Temporal Transaction Data. IEEE
  Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,
  15(6):1025-1032, 2009. (DOI)

### Paper Type: Evaluation

Evaluation papers explore the usage of visualization and visual
analytics by human users, and typically present an empirical study of
visualization techniques or systems. Authors are not necessarily
expected to implement the systems used in these studies themselves;
the research contribution will be judged on the validity and
importance of the results as opposed to the novelty of the systems or
techniques under study. The conference committee appreciates the
difficulty and importance of designing and performing rigorous
evaluation, including the definition of appropriate hypotheses, tasks,
data sets, selection of subjects and cases, data collection,
validation and conclusions. The goal of such efforts should be to move
from description toward prediction and explanation.

Carpendale (2008) provides excellent advice to guide research in
InfoVis evaluation:

* Empirical methodology must be chosen sensitively as a good fit to
  the research question, the situation and the research goals.
* Studies must be conducted with appropriate rigor as dictated by the
  selected methodology. Trying to fit the rigor from one methodology
  onto another is rarely appropriate.
* Sufficient details should be published so that the reader can fully
  understand the processes and reproduce processes and results if
  appropriate. We welcome supplementary materials that address this
  need.
* Claims that are made should be appropriate to the strengths of the
  chosen methodology and evaluation design. For example, if a given
  methodology or research data set does not generalize well, then
  generalizations should not be drawn from the results.

### Paper Type: Theory/Model

Theory/Model papers present new interpretations of the foundational
theory of visualization and visual analytics, including models,
typologies or taxonomies of the design, development, or use of
visualization in particular contexts. Implementations are usually not
relevant for papers in this category. Papers should focus on basic
advancement in our understanding of how visualization techniques
complement and exploit properties of human vision and cognition.
