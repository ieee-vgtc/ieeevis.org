#### Sunday

* **[VAST Challenge](http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2017)** -
The Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems.

* *Tutorial* - **[Visualization Analysis and Design](/year/2017/info/tutorials#Visualization_Analysis_Design)**

* *Tutorial* - **[Applying Color Theory to VIS](/year/2017/info/tutorials#Applying_Color_Theory)**

* *Tutorial* - **[Sketching Designs for Data Visualization using the Five Design-Sheet Methodology](/year/2017/info/tutorials#Five_Design-Sheet)**

* *Workshop* - **[AVID: Advancing Visualization Inclusion and Diversity](/year/2017/info/workshops#avid)**

#### Monday

* *Workshop* - **[Vis in Practice: Visualization Solutions in the Wild](http://www.visinpractice.rwth-aachen.de/workshop.html)** -
Providing an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying the latest visualization and visual analytics research to real world problems.

* **[Discovery Jam](http://discoveryjam.com/)** - 
A live hackathon to scientific data discovery. You’ll leave the workshop with skills for communicating with scientists, approaches to cross-disciplinary collaboration, and new ideas to pursue further.
