## IEEE VIS events interesting for all practitioners

#### Sunday

* **[VAST Challenge](http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2017)** -
The Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems.

* *Tutorial* - **[Visualization Analysis and Design](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/tutorials#Visualization_Analysis_Design)**

* *Tutorial* - **[Applying Color Theory to VIS](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/tutorials#Applying_Color_Theory)**
