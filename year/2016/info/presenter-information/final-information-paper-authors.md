This page provides authors of accepted papers with important information for the remainder of the process until the conference.

### CAMERA READY PAPERS SUBMISSION

**DEADLINE: August 1**. Final papers and supplemental materials due at https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/

Camera-ready papers may not exceed 10 pages (9 pages of main text and 1 page of references) for the journal track, and 8 pages (7.5 pages of main text and .5 page of references) for the conference track. The [website](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Track/vis-menu.html) has complete information regarding formatting requirements of your final revised PDF, copyright form, and optional videos. We do not need hardcopy. Please note in particular the suggestions for ensuring that the images in your PDF document are stored at sufficiently high resolution instead of using the default lossy compression settings.

Please check the second round reviewer comments (if any) and incorporate their suggestions. Note: there will not be further detailed proof-reading of your submission, so PLEASE read through your manuscript very carefully to fix any remaining grammar and spelling problems. If you are not a native English speaker, we very strongly recommend you recruit one to do the final careful pass on your paper. Also note the strict page limits. The 10th page, if used, may not contain anything other than references (we will be strict on this). Finally, your paper should not be anonymized in the final version. The paper must include authors and affiliations. Note that if you have been anonymizing then you may find you have to trim your text to fit into the page limits once authors and affiliations are added.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure the final submission data in PCS is identical to the final PDF (e.g. title, author names and lastnames, affiliations, author order, emails.) You might need to correct the information in your PCS login in order to update the author information. You can do this by logging into their PCS account > my account > Change my contact information.

You can include a video of your work on the conference USB. Videos can be up to 5 minutes in length, and you may also include other supplemental material such as additional images or source code on the USB. The web site above includes information on how to do so. The supplementary materials submitted initially for the 1st review cycle will NOT be automatically included in the conference USB or IEEE digital library. Only those submitted in the final version slot will.

At least one author per accepted paper must register to present the work. Also, an author from each paper will present a short preview during the first session.

### VIDEO PREVIEW SUBMISSION

It is mandatory for authors of all VIS papers to submit a 30-sec Video Preview by August 1, 2015 (5:00pm PDT) on [PCS](http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/).

The Video Preview instructions are online at http://ieeevis.org/year/2015/info/presenter-information/video-previews.

We are looking forward to an exciting and vibrant IEEE VIS 2016!
