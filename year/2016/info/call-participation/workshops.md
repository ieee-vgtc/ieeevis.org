We solicit half-day workshops related to all areas of visualization including information visualization, scientific visualization, and visual analytics. The workshops venue at IEEE VIS provides an informal setting for participants to discuss advanced technical topics in visualization, involve experts in the field, disseminate work in progress, and promote new ideas.

Workshops should:

* emphasize emerging ideas, concepts, or technologies that are
  currently too nascent or too interdisciplinary for a full symposium;
  or
* bring together experts on a subject to create a report, white-paper,
  or proposal requiring interactive work sessions that is of potential
  interest to a substantial segment of the visualization community.

A distinction that separates workshops from tutorials and symposia is
that the information flow for a workshop should not be directed solely
from the presenters to the audience. Rather, workshops should engage
the participation of all attendees. **Workshops at IEEE VIS are open to
all registered attendees** and ‘invitation only’ workshops will not be
approved.

Papers submitted and presented as part of workshops will not be published in the proceedings of the conference. Depending on interest and actual time schedule of each workshop, it may be possible to include workshop material on the USB drive for dissemination to venue attendees.

Workshop organizers should consider publication strategies, since workshop papers will not be published in the main conference proceedings. Organizers can request that workshop materials be included on the USB drive for dissemination to attendees of the conference, if the camera-ready deadline is earlier than September 1, 2016.

Proposals should include:

* a title,
* the contact details of the organizers,
* a brief description of organizers' background, related publications, and research,
* the goals, the technical scope, the mission, and the proposed focus,
* the planned activities,
* the length should be half day; only in special cases full day workshops might be considered,
* a statement of the organization and the development of the list of
  participants (intended size, detailed selection procedures and
  timeline for finalizing workshop presenters),
* the requested facilities (room setup as a round table, lecture
  theater, or in a panel format), and
* the intended result & impact of the workshop results.
* the proposed dates of the call for participation, author
  notification, and camera-ready deadlines (notification must be prior
  to the early registration deadline of September 9 2016)

The proposal should not exceed **four** pages. Please visit
  [http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) for formatting
  guidelines and submit via PCS [http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/)
  
The workshops will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

* the potential for inspiring people, being influential, and opening new lines of research,
* the ability to attract people and make them excited about it,
* the appropriateness with respect to IEEE VIS topics,
* the qualification of the organizers,
* the feasibility of the proposed plan (financial, time plan, etc.), and
* the coherence of the proposed topic.

If the proposed workshop is a follow-up on a previous workshop, please
include a discussion of the results and the impact of the previous
workshop. The aim of workshops is to include a variety of topics, thus
repeat submissions will be judged in part by the success of the
previous workshop. Workshop success will be measured subjectively, but
popularity, research impact, visibility, and attendee feedback will
all be taken into account.

In addition, the workshop chairs will try to balance the proposed
topics in order to support the diversity of topics within the IEEE VIS
venue and complement the main program of the conference.

Accepted workshops are required to prepare a short summary for the printed program (~50 words).
