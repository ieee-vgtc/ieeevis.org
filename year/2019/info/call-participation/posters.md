The **IEEE VIS 2019 Poster Program** offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work  or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the Plagiarism statement in the end)   through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

In addition to a poster being displayed throughout IEEE VIS:

* a two-page summary of your work will be included in the electronic conference proceedings (USB memory stick distributed to conference attendees);
* interactive poster sessions will provide a forum for presenting your work and discussing new ideas with your peers;
* [video previews](/year/2019/info/presenter-information/fast-forward-and-video-previews) for posters are strongly suggested;
* one presenter per poster will be eligible for the reduced conference rate for authors;
* best poster design award will be chosen (new this year). 

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to:

* research exploring new problems or areas,
* the results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization and analytics techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.

We particularly encourage contributions that take advantage of the nature of the poster space and forum to present and raise awareness of the work in effective and imaginative ways. 

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in the VGTC conference two-column format in line with the IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting Guidelines: [http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Track/vis.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Track/vis.html) and use the poster format.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the
results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion
of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full
literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations
should be included.

The posters themselves have no predefined formatting, but dimensions 
may not exceed A0 paper size (841mm x 1189mm / 33.1" x 46.8"). **ONLY
PORTRAIT FORMAT IS ACCEPTABLE**. Poster authors are strongly encouraged to include an optional draft of their poster layout and content. This addition gives a clear idea to reviewers of what to expect at the conference and provides the opportunity for authors to receive feedback. All submissions should be in PDF format.

Those who intend to show demos are also highly encouraged to submit an accompanying video or other supplementary materials by following  the IEEE VIS formatting guidelines
[http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/supplement.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/supplement.html).

Authors whose posters are accepted for IEEE VIS will be asked to refine their posters and summaries based upon feedback from reviewers.

The poster itself only needs to be prepared for and brought to the poster session at IEEE VIS but should be on display throughout the week.  

Visit the [Posters FAQ](http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/info/call-participation/posters-faq) page for some useful tips for authors.

### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All IEEE VIS poster submissions should be made through a single
submission category on PCS - IEEE VIS Poster.

After logging into PCS at [https://new.precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](https://new.precisionconference.com/~vgtc/), start your submission by selecting "IEEE VIS Posters 2019" and then select the conference to which you are submitting a poster:

* Scientific Visualization (SciVis) <!-- - for conference themes see  
  [IEEE SciVis 2019 – Topics and Paper Types](/year/2019/info/call-participation/scivis-paper-types) -->
* Information Visualization (InfoVis) <!-- - for conference themes see  
  [IEEE InfoVis 2019 – Topics and Paper Types](/year/2019/info/call-participation/infovis-paper-types) -->
* Visual Analytics Science and Technologies (VAST) <!-- - for conference
  themes see [IEEE VAST 2019 – Topics and Paper Types](/year/2019/info/call-participation/vast-paper-types) -->

### Plagiarism
All submissions must be either: 1) original work that has not been presented previously at any workshop, symposium, or conference, or published previously in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal; or 2) a summary that highlights work presented or published in a related venue with a clear statement of attribution to the original work.
At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves, or is a summary of previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to a removal of the submission from the review process. For more information, please see the IEEE plagiarism FAQ and the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual.


### IMPORTANT DATES

All deadlines are at **5:00pm Pacific Time (PDT)**.

### POSTER SESSION

Authors of accepted posters are required to bring an explanatory hardcopy poster for display during IEEE VIS. One or more authors have to be available at the poster to discuss their work during the scheduled evening poster session(s).

All authors who plan to show live demos or video should clearly indicate this fact in their submissions. We encourage you to bring a laptop to the poster session where small tables will be provided.

### POSTER REVIEW PROCESS

Each poster submission will be read and evaluated by at least two reviewers.

Submissions will be evaluated according to four reviewing criteria: originality, significance, suitability for the venue (levels of interest, relevance) and the potential for spurring discussion.

All authors will receive reviews of their submission explaining the decision and providing feedback. Authors of posters that are accepted are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER RESEARCH AWARDS 

The chairs of each conference will award two categories of awards. The ‘Best Poster Research’ awards will recognize the most significant research contributions based on the submitted two-page poster summary. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate. 

### BEST POSTER DESIGN AWARDS

New this year, one poster from each conference will be awarded for ‘Best Poster Design’, which recognizes exemplary use of the poster medium to communicate about research. This will be judged based on the clarity and design of the poster displayed at the conference.  'Best Poster Presentation’ authors will receive a signed certificate to display with their poster at the event.
