The **IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis)** conference solicits original research papers on a diverse
set of topics related to scientific visualization. Papers may contribute new or improved visual encoding
or interaction techniques; evaluations of techniques and tools; models or theories related to scientific
visualization; systems that support visual data analysis; and the application of scientific visualization
to a broad range of real-world contexts and domains.

## Topics

Research contributions are welcomed across a range of topics including, but not limited to:

* **Visualization, rendering, and manipulation of spatial data:** scalar, vector, and tensor fields; multidimensional, multi-field, multi-modal, and multivariate data; time-varying data; regular and unstructured grids; point-based data; and volumetric data.
* **Foundations:** visualization taxonomies and models; mathematical theories for visualization; perception (theory, color, texture, scene, motion); cognition; aesthetics; information theoretic approaches; knowledge-assisted visualization; presentation; production; dissemination; and visual design.

## Paper Types
VIS papers often fall into one or more of five main categories: technique or algorithm; system;
application of design study; empirical study; theory or model. Although your main paper type has to
be specified during the paper submission process, papers can include elements of more than one of
these categories.

### Paper Type: Technique & Algorithm
A **technique** or **algorithm** paper introduces a novel technique or algorithm that has not previously
appeared in the literature, or that significantly extends known techniques or algorithms. The technique
or algorithm description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent graduate
student in visualization could implement the work, and the authors should create a prototype
implementation of the methods. This technique should ideally be of general application rather than be
restricted to a single task or single source of data, and the exposition should be focused on what the
technique does, how it does it, the tasks and datasets for which this new method is appropriate, and
what the computational and other costs are. Evaluation is likely to strengthen technique papers.

Examples:

* Günther, T., Schulze, M., and Theisel, H. (2016). Rotation Invariant Vortices for Flow Visualization. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 22(1).
* Jönsson, D. and Ynnerman, A. (2017). Correlated Photon Mapping for Interactive Global Illumination of Time-Varying Volumetric Data. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23(1).
* Tierny, J. and Carr, H. (2017). Jacobi Fiber Surfaces for Bivariate Reeb Space Computation. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23(1).

### Paper Type: System
A **system** paper describes a solution to a problem where the major task is building a large complex
software artifact, applying largely known visualization techniques. The system that is described is both
novel and important, and has been implemented. Here, the focus should be on the design decisions,
the implications for software / hardware structure, and comparison with other systems. The
comparison includes specific discussion of how the described system differs from and is, in some
significant respects, superior to those systems.

Examples:

* Moreland, K., Sewell, C., Usher, W., Lo, L.-T., Meredith, J., Pugmire, D., Kress, J., Schroots, H., Ma, K.-L., Childs, H., Larsen, M., Che, C.-M., Maynard, R., and Geveci, B. (2016).

* Wald, I., Johnson, G. P., Amstutz, J., Brownlee, C., Knoll, A., Jeffers, J., Günther, J., andNavratil, P. (2017). OSPRay – A CPU Ray Tracing Framework for Scientific Visualization. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23(1).

### Paper Type: Application & Design Study
An **application** or **design study** paper explores the choices made when applying visualization
techniques in an application area, for example relating the visual encodings and interaction techniques
to the requirements of the target task. These papers typically include an encapsulated description of a
problem domain and the questions to be resolved by visualization, then describes the application of
visualization to the task, any novel techniques developed, and how the visualization solution answered
the questions posed. The results of the study, including insights generated in the application domain
and visualization knowledge generated through the research process, should be clearly conveyed. The
work will be judged by the design lessons learned or insights gleaned for visualization research - which
may or may not include novel visualization techniques, algorithms, or systems - on which future
contributors can build. We invite submissions on any application area.

### Paper Type: Empirical Study
An empirical study paper explores the usage of visualization by people or provides a detailed
analysis of the characteristics of a visualization approach, for example, its technical performance. This
kind of paper presents a study, either qualitative or quantitative, of visualization techniques or
systems. The research contribution will be judged on the validity and importance of the results,
including, where appropriate, the definition of hypotheses, tasks, data sets, the rigorous collection and
examination/analysis/coding of data, the selection of subjects and cases, as well as validation,
discussion, and conclusions.

* Stevens, A. H., Butkiewicz, T., and Ware, C. (2017). Hairy Slices: Evaluating the Perceptual Effectiveness of Cutting Plane Glyphs for 3D Vector Fields. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23(1).

### Paper Type: Theory & Model
A theory or model paper presents new interpretations of the foundational theory of visualization,
including models, typologies or taxonomies of the design, development, evaluation, or use of
visualization in particular contexts. These papers do not require implementation, but contribute by
illuminating how visualization techniques complement and exploit properties of human vision and
cognition, as well as how researchers conduct effective and rigorous visualization studies.
