title: IEEE Vis 2019 - Short Papers Call for Participation

IEEE Vis 2019 solicits submissions in a short paper format. Short papers draw from the same paper types and topics as full papers of VAST, Infovis and Scivis, ranging from theoretical to applied research contributions. 

Short papers welcome submissions describing original work with focused and concise research contributions, incremental work such as follow-up extensions or evaluations of existing methods, or exploratory work. We provide example papers below.    

The short paper submission deadline is June 13, 2019, creating an opportunity to showcase late-breaking research results. This deadline is one week after the June 6 notification for conditional acceptance of full papers, enabling the distillation and focused expression of work that otherwise might not be part of VIS.  

### Submission Guidelines:

Short papers can be up to four pages plus up to one page of references. Submissions will be in the VGTC conference two-column format, in line with the [IEEE VIS formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html). Short papers may be single-blind or double-blind - reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to anonymize their submission or not.

Short papers must be submitted through the [Precision Conference System](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions).

### Example Papers:
* Max Zeyen, Tobias Post, Hans Hagen, James Ahrens, David Rogers, and Roxana Bujack. [Color interpolation for non-Euclidean color spaces](https://datascience.dsscale.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/ColorInterpolationforNon-EuclideanColorSpaces.pdf). SciVis 2018 Short Papers.
* Anke Friederici, Habib Toye, Ibrahim Hoteit, Tino Weinkauf, Holger Theisel, and Markus Hadwiger. [A Lagrangian Method for Extracting Eddy Boundaries in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden](http://vccvisualization.org/publications/2018_friederici_redseaeddies.pdf). SciVis 2018 Short Papers.
* Oliver Reiter, Marcel Breeuwer, Eduard Gröller, and Renata Georgia Raidou. [Comparative visual analysis of pelvic organ segmentations](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_270791.pdf). EuroVis 2018 Short Papers. 
* Marco Angelini, Graziano Blasilli, Simone Lenti, and Giuseppe Santucci. [STEIN: speeding up evaluation activities with a Seamless Testing Environment INtegrator](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Angelini/publication/326446935_STEIN_speeding_up_evaluation_activities_with_a_Seamless_Testing_Environment_INtegrator/links/5b4e039ea6fdcc8dae278c83/STEIN-speeding-up-evaluation-activities-with-a-Seamless-Testing-Environment-INtegrator.pdf). EuroVis 2018 Short Papers.
* Natalie Kerracher, Jessie B. Kennedy, and Kevin Chalmers. [Using a task classification in the visualisation design process for task understanding and abstraction: an empirical study](https://www.napier.ac.uk/~/media/worktribe/output-1218523/using-a-task-classification-in-the-visualisation-design-process-for-task-understanding-and.pdf). EuroVis 2018 Short Papers.
* Fabian Schwarzinger, Andreas Roschal, and Theresia Gschwandtner. [Sketching Temporal Uncertainty-An Exploratory User Study](https://www.cvast.tuwien.ac.at/sites/default/files/schwarzinger_eurovis2018_preprint.pdf). EuroVis 2018 Short Papers.


### Publication Details:
Accepted short papers will be presented at the VIS conference. They will also be included on the conference proceedings and published in IEEE Xplore with a proper DOI number.  

Authors of accepted short papers may subsequently submit to TVCG (the journal, not to the VIS conference) a full paper on the same topic, consistent with the TVCG standard of asking for "more than 30 percent new material and insights" compared to work that has previously been presented at a conference.

### Important Dates:

* Submission Deadline: **June 13, 2019**
* Notification: **July 18, 2019**
* Submission of Camera-Ready Final Version: **August 1, 2019**

All deadlines are at **5:00pm Pacific Time (PDT)**.
