## <a name="Topo"></a> Topological Data Analysis Made Easy with the Topology ToolKit, A Sequel
Sunday, October 20: 9:00am-12:20pm

This tutorial presents topological methods for the analysis and
visualization of scientific data from a user’s perspective, with the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a recently released open-source library for
topological data analysis. Topological methods have gained considerably
in popularity and maturity over the last twenty years and success
stories of established methods have been documented in a wide range of
applications (combustion, chemistry, astrophysics, material sciences,
etc.) with both acquired and simulated data, in both post-hoc and
in-situ contexts. Last year, we held the first iteration of this
tutorial, that aimed to cover this area at a software level and from a
user’s point-of-view. This tutorial aims to continue to fill a gap by
providing a beginner’s introduction to topological methods for
practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular,
instead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this
tutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice
for concrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature
extraction or tracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve
these tasks with TTK. First, after an introduction to topological
methods and their application in data analysis, a brief overview of
TTK’s main entry point for end users, namely ParaView, will be
presented. Second, an overview of TTK’s main features will be given. A
running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access
TTK’s features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on
sessions will concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple,
representative data analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be
presented for developers, in particular by describing several examples
of visualization and data analysis projects that were built on top of
TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the usage of TTK as a teaching
platform for topological analysis will be given. Presenters of this
tutorial include experts in topological methods, core authors of TTK as
well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or industry. A large
part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises and a rich
material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines, code,
data, demos, video tutorials, etc. see last year’s tutorial website
[11]) will be provided to the participants. This tutorial mostly targets
students, practitioners and researchers who are not necessarily experts
in topological methods but who are interested in using them in their
daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological
methods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK. We
kindly ask potential attendees to optionally pre-register at the
following address, in order for us to reach out to them ahead of the
tutorial with information updates (for instance, last minute updates,
instructions for the download of the tutorial material package, etc.):

## <a name="Networks"></a> Visualizing Multivariate Networks
Sunday, October 20: 9:00am-12:40pm

Carolina Nobre, *University of Utah*  
Marc Streit, *Johannes Kepler University*  
Alexander Lex, *University of Utah*  

Multivariate networks (MVNs) are made up of nodes and their
relationships (links), but also data about those nodes and links as
attributes. Visualizing MVNs, however, is challenging, especially when
both the topology of the network and the attributes need to be
considered concurrently. In this tutorial, we will explore how MVNs can
be visualized, including real-world examples and practical guidelines on
choosing an appropriate technique. The tutorial starts with a network
sketching activity to get participants engaged and thinking about the
challenges inherent to visualizing MVNs. The second section is devoted
to understanding network types and analysis tasks, including how MVN
tasks can be described as a function of attributes and target
topological structures. We divide the remaining time into four parts,
each focused on a category of MVN visualization techniques: node-link
layouts, tabular layouts, implicit layouts, and multiple coordinated
views. Each section will contain an explanation of the technique,
followed by real-world usage examples. We conclude each section with a
set of actionable guidelines on when to use the proposed techniques
based on network characteristics and analyst tasks. These guidelines are
also available for future reference in a companion website, available at
[https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/mvnv/](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/mvnv/). 
The website provides an overview of all
techniques as well as a wizard designed to help users select a technique
for a specific data and task combination.


## <a name="VTK"></a> VTK-m - A ToolKit for Scientific Visualization on Many-Core Processors
Sunday, October 20: 2:20pm-5:40pm

Hank Childs, *University of Oregon*  
Kenneth Moreland, *Sandia National Laboratories*  
David Pugmire, *Oak Ridge National Laboratory*  
Robert Maynard, *Kitware*  

This tutorial will cover the VTK-m software, i.e., the many-core version
of VTK (a popular open source toolkit for scientific visualization).
VTK-m provides a portable performance infrastructure, which enables
efficient performance on multi-core CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, and provides
an easy extensibility path to future architectures. Tutorial
presentations will focus both on how to use VTK-m and on how to develop
VTK-m code.


## <a name="Better_Presentations"></a> Better Presentations for Visualization Research
Sunday, October 20: 2:20pm-5:40pm

Jon Schwabish, *Urban Institute/PolicyViz*  
 
Good visualization research presentations—as well as presentations for
clients, administrators, and other stakeholders—can be crucial for
helping audiences understand the impacts of research and, ultimately,
for adopting research approaches and recommendations. Too many
researchers and practitioners prepare presentations by simply converting
reports to slides—text becomes bullet points, tables and figures get
copied and pasted. Presentations, however, are a fundamentally different
form of communication than writing. When researchers treat their
presentations and papers identically, they miss this important
distinction, as well as the opportunity to share their work as
effectively as possible.
 
Visualization researchers commonly face the following challenges when presenting their work to an audience:
- Deciding how much detail to include when presenting the experiment design
- presenting key results in a digestible way
- explaining algorithms and the math behind them
- deciding whether to perform demonstrations or show videos, and
- time constraints (e.g., presenting detailed research in 15 minutes)

The goal of this workshop is to provide attendees the tools and
strategies to address these challenges and help their audiences
understand their research and analysis.

In this half-day workshop, attendees learn how to better present their
work to researchers, practitioners, decisionmakers, and others. The
workshop is divided into three main instruction sections and includes
hands-on exercises where attendees work with worksheets and sample
slides. A sample agenda can be found in section 2 of this proposal.

Three primary themes drive the entire workshop, from design to
delivery. First, presenters should visualize their content. Studies
have consistently shown that we better comprehend and retain
information when we have pictures to accompany or replace text. Second,
presenters should unify the elements of their presentation. This means
consistency in colors and fonts, in slide formats, and in integrating
images and verbal commentary. Finally, presenters need to focus their
audience’s attention on specific bits of text, graphic elements, or
slide objects. Rather than putting up as much information as possible
on every slide—which many presenters do because it’s easy and it
reminds them to cover each point—slides should be simple and free of
clutter so that they can direct the audience’s attention to the desired
position on the screen. Attendees are provided with worksheets and
other handouts, as well as copies of the instructor’s book, Better
Presentations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks.

 
## <a name="VDA"></a> Visual Analysis and Design
Monday, October 21: 9:00am-12:20pm

Tamara Munzner, *University of British Columbia*  

This introductory tutorial will provide a broad foundation for thinking
systematically about visualization systems, built around the idea that
becoming familiar with analyzing existing systems is a good springboard
for designing new ones. The major data types of concern in visual
analytics, information visualization, and scientific visualization will
all be covered: tables, networks, and sampled spatial data. This
tutorial is focused on data and task abstractions, and the design
choices for visual encoding and interaction; it will not cover
algorithms. No background in computer science or visualization is
assumed.


## <a name="Stats"></a> Statistical Data Representation, Visualization, and Uncertainty Analysis
Monday, October 21: 9:00am-12:20pm

Soumya Dutta, *Los Alamos National Laboratory*

Efficient analysis and visualization of data using statistical methods
have benefited the visualization community for many years. As the size
of data grows rapidly, researchers are increasingly relying on
techniques aiming primarily at the efficient identification and analysis
of regions that are characterized by the presence of characteristic
features, instead of looking at the data at its entirety. Using
statistical distributions, statistical characteristics of data can be
compactly represented, efficiently analyzed and visualized. Recent
developments have demonstrated the broad applicability of statistical
distributions in data visualization by introducing novel stochastic
algorithms and addressing important problems such as feature
identification, extraction, and tracking; multi-variable relationship
exploration; query-driven visualization; in-situ data summary, and many
more.

Besides being able to compactly represent statistical data properties, a
key advantage of statistical distribution-based data analysis techniques
is the ability to quantify uncertainty during visualization.
Uncertainty-aware visualization algorithms developed using statistical
methods and distribution-based data representations can successfully
communicate the trustworthiness of the visual representation to the
application scientists so that the scientists can draw meaningful
conclusions from the visualization results. As we step into the era of
big data, the relevance of statistical distribution-based methods has
become even more prominent since statistical distributions can be used
to generate compact data summaries, which are significantly smaller than
the full-resolution raw data and such data triage can be performed in
situ. As a result, a variety of visualization applications using
statistical distributions has been developed which evidently indicate
that such uncertainty-aware statistical methods will provide a promising
path forward in the future.

Considering the aforementioned benefits of statistical methods in data
visualization, we propose to organize a half-day tutorial on statistical
data representation, visualization, and uncertainty analysis. The
tutorial will highlight concepts related to general statistical methods
of data visualization, with a focus on statistical distribution-based
techniques. A comprehensive discussion on the state of the art of
uncertainty-aware visualization algorithms using distributional data
will be conducted, serving as a basis for audiences interested in
research in statistical data representation and processing, with
applications in data analysis, visualization, and uncertainty
quantification. We will systematically introduce different categories of
visual-analytics algorithms that use and benefit from statistical
methods. In addition, concepts and applications of uncertainty-aware
visualization techniques will be presented. Finally, the latest research
trends and applications utilizing statistical data representations will
be discussed. The tutorial will conclude, by highlighting future scopes
and open problems that have to be solved for the further advancement of
statistically supported methods of data visualization.


## <a name="Paper_Types"></a> Beyond Paper Types: How to Evaluate and Communicate VIS Research Contributions
Monday, October 21: 9:00am-12:20pm

Bongshin Lee, *Microsoft Research*  
Petra Isenberg, *Inria*  
John Stasko, *Georgia Institute of Technology*  
Daniel Weiskopf, *University of Stuttgart*  
Ross Maciejewski, *Arizona State University*  

Peer review plays a critical role in ensuring and improving the quality
of academic research publications, and has a huge influence on culture
of the research community. However, compared to the amount of advice and
training one can find on how to write a research paper, little training
or material is available on how to provide constructive feedback as a
reviewer. The goal of our tutorial is to teach basic yet practical
skills needed to evaluate visualization research papers, focusing on
research contributions, and convey their assessments in a constructive
way. Students can use this skill not only to write good reviews but also
to better frame their own papers as an author.


## <a name="Social"></a> Visualization for Social Good
Monday, October 21: 2:20pm-5:40pm

Leilani Battle, *University of Maryland*  
Michelle A. Borkin, *Northeastern University*  
Michael Correll, *Tableau Research*  
Lane Harrison, *Worcester Polytechnic Institute*  
Evan Peck, *Bucknell University*  

We propose a tutorial based around the premise that visualization
researchers, teachers, and practitioners can and should use the
explanatory and persuasive power of visualizations to promote social
good in their communities and the wider world. The skills required to
make these sorts of impacts are often excluded from standard
visualization curricula, requiring considerations of presenting data to
diverse audiences, working with uncertain data sources, and examining
the ethical impacts of data collection and analysis. This tutorial is
centered around a hackathon event in which attendees will work together
with their complementary skillsets to produce any one of a number of
potential contributions to a social issue: a novel visualization, a
novel dataset, or even just a new perspective on an existing problem.


## <a name="Eval"></a> User-Centred Evaluation in Visualization  
Monday, October 21: 2:20pm-5:40pm

Camilla Forsell, *Linköping University*  
Matthew Cooper, *Linköping University*  
Niklas Rönnberg, *Linköping University*  

The objective of this half-day introductory tutorial in user-centred
evaluation in visualization is to introduce the topic, provide general
knowledge about what is important to consider and what resources are
available to support further study in this area. Participants will also
learn to better judge the relevance and quality of a publication which
includes an evaluation since similar rules apply. By providing the
fundamental insights in the subject, the tutorial also seeks to
encourage the participants to further deepen their knowledge after
completion of the tutorial by self-studies or participating in a course.
