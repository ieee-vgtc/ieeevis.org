VIS Paper presenters have 15 minutes --- including questions --- for
their talk. Please be respectful of this time limit.  

VIS **Short Paper** presenters have 10 minutes --- including questions --- for
their talk. The suggestion is 7 minutes for the presentation and 3 minutes for questions. Please be respectful of this time limit.  

All meeting rooms will be equipped with a projector with a minimum
native resolution of 1280 X 800. Each room is equipped with a "state
of the art", industry standard, HDMI scaler that will handle a maximum
resolution of 1920 X 1200.

To gain maximum size and benefit on the screen, we encourage speakers
to utilize the 16x9 wide format Powerpoint templates.

[**Download the Powerpoint template file**](/attachments/vis19-16x9-Tahoma.ppt).

We will have switched connections for presentations from laptops.

Presenters are encouraged to bring their own laptop (with video adapter if your laptop does not have standard HD15 (VGA),
HDMI, or DVI connections) for panels, papers, and presentations. 

We support computer audio in each of the rooms with 2+ connections
that are shared between the presenters. We also have 2+ wireless
lavilier mics in each room to be shared between presenters.

Presenters are expected to arrive to their session 15 minutes early to
meet their session chair and receive final instructions.
