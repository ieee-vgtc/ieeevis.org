Please **read the following instructions carefully** and submit your
25-second video for the Video Previews archive and Fast Forward
conference session by **August 15, 2019**.

Video previews and fast forwards are a great opportunity to publicize
your work or event to a wide audience. Video previews are accessible
from the conference website on the VIS Vimeo channel prior to, during,
and after the conference. At least one author for each accepted
submission is required to present a 25-second preview of their work
during a Fast Forward (FF) session held at the conference. The same
25-second video supports both purposes: it will be archivally
available as a standalone video with audio track, and it will also be
played during the FF session **without** the audio track while the
author speaks. Voiceover narration in the audio track is strongly
recommended to make the archival video most useful, but is not
mandatory.
