VISKids has provided child care grants to VIS conference attendees since 2015. As part of Inclusivity and Diversity at IEEE VIS, VISKids also organize activities at the conference, and has a meeting room at the site.
The activities and the room are *open to everyone,* not just awardees of the child care grant program.


### VISKids Child Care Grants

Grants of up to $500 per family are available for VIS attendees who are bringing small children to the conference or who incur extra expenses in leaving their children at home. The grants will be given as a reimbursement for expenses but attendees are responsible for making their own arrangements for child care. If requests exceed available funding, or if additional funding becomes available, preference will be given to students and early career attendees who are presenting at the conference.

See the dedicated page for [child care grants](./viskids-child-care-grants) for details.

### VISKids Room

Throughout the duration of the conference, VISKids will have a room for meetings, discussions, play, and personal considerations (e.g., nursing). Kids are very welcome and encouraged to come hang-out!


### VISKids Hello

At the beginning of the conference, we will have a short gathering to inform about the VISKids grants and activities. The VISKids co-chairs will answer all questions. Everyone is welcome.
