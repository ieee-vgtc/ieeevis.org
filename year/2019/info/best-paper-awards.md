Best paper and honorable mention awards are selected per conference track by a dedicated committee of experienced community members. 
Both awards recognize outstanding work from the pool of accepted papers in each conference track.  
Best paper committees use a variety of criteria to select the best paper including potential impact to the community, 
the importance of any results obtained, technical challenges overcome, etc. 
Generally only one best paper is selected per conference track each year and up to three honorable mention awards.
