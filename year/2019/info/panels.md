## <a name="panel-freire">Exploring Reproducibility in Vis: Expanding on the National Academies' Report on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science</a>

Tuesday, October 22: 2:20-3:50PM in Room 2+3

Organizers: Juliana Freire (New York University), Jean-Daniel Fekete (Inria), Steve Haroz (Inria), Carlos Scheidegger (University of Arizona)

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has recently released the report Reproducibility and Replicability in Science. This report has prompted discussions within many disciplines about the extent of reproducibility and replicability challenges and strategies for improving. This panel discussion will begin with an overview of the National Academies' report, followed by comments from other panelists on particular reproducibility challenges faced by the visualization community and how those challenges might be addressed.

## <a name="panel-abdul-rahman">Top Research Questions for Empirical Studies in Visualization</a>

Wednesday, October 23: 2:20-3:50PM in Room 8+15

Organizers: Brian Fisher (Simon Fraser University), Petra Isenberg (Inria), David H. Laidlaw	(Brown University), Melanie Tory (Tableau Research), Daniel Weiskopf (University of Stuttgart), Alfie Abdul-Rahman (King's College London)

Empirical studies are an indispensable component in visualization as they allow us to not only understand the interactions between humans and computers, but they also enable us to evaluate and confirm our results and experiments.

In this panel, we ask five researchers â€“ "What are the top research questions for empirical studies in visualization?" Our panelists will cover a range of topics including:

- A focus on cognitive science as well as synthesizing theoretical perspectives;
- Causes of empirical studies focusing on narrow hypotheses vs. broad hypotheses as well as mechanisms for tracking them;
- Understanding human-computer interaction in visualization and how we can predict performance;
- The need for a great diversity of empirical studies and the gap between research and practice; and
- Empirical research beyond user studies, quantitative characterizations to evaluate visualization, as well as the role of eye tracking.

## <a name="panel-fisher2">Visual Analytics, past, present and future</a>

Thursday, October 24: 2:20-3:50PM in Room 2+3

Organizers: Brian Fisher (Simon Fraser University), Kristin Cook (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory), David Ebert (Purdue University), Daniel Keim (University of Konstanz)

We have brought together leaders of the three groups that created visual analytics: a co-editor of Illuminating the Path, the leader of VisMaster, and the leader of VACCINE to discuss the history, present state, and future of visual analytics, "the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces". In an open discussion with attendees panelists will give their perspectives on the origins and evolving goals of VA, what has worked, what has not, and what we have learned in the VA effort that might help us to build a more diverse and impactful VIS.
