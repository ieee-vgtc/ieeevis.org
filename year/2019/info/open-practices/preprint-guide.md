Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations.

## Open Access Repository Criteria

The repository must meet the following criteria:

1.  Findable - The repository project must be indexed or registered via a searchable resource such as Google
1.  Freely accessible - There can be no cost or sign-up requirement for viewing
1.  Identifiable - Content has a unique and persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI or Arxiv ID). The content is also immutable and timestamped (multiple versions of the content are fine, as long as the previous versions and timestamps are retained)
1.  Reliable - The repository has a stated plan for long-term reliability ([example](http://help.osf.io/m/faqs/l/726460-faqs#what-if-you-run-out-of-funding-what-happens-to-my-data))
    

The following are currently the only repositories that are confirmed to meet all criteria for being findable, freely accessible, uniquely identifiable, and reliable:

-   [http://osf.io/preprints](http://osf.io/preprints) - [walkthrough for posting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsNLXSDZB5MOTj0FGtPNGZ4FKSAGJ4FrtgoMZf4z-xw/edit?usp=sharing)
   
-   [http://arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org) - [[walkthrough in progress](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oth87A9mnXK_skh1zgplto4W_eXYPZHkY3DN26gWUR4/edit)]
    
-   [http://zenodo.org](http://zenodo.org)
    
If you would like to use another repository that you believe meets the criteria, please email open_practices@ieeevis.org

A personal website, lab website, or Github repository does NOT meet the criteria.

## Sharing the Open Version with VIS

After your paper is accepted and before the print deadline, PCS will have a textbox where you can enter the URL of your paper. It should be the final “author version” of your paper. If you have any issues, please contact the open practice chairs. If you cannot share a preprint, you must enter the reason instead of the URL. 

  

## Is sharing the preprint compatible with IEEE’s publication policy?

Yes! Until you sign the IEEE copyright policy, the paper is 100% yours, and you can post it anywhere you like. After you sign the copyright form, IEEE explicitly allows you to keep the article on an open access preprint repository. This quote comes from the [IEEE author FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/author_faq.pdf):

Can an author post his manuscript on a preprint server such as ArXiv?

> Yes. The IEEE recognizes that many authors share their unpublished
> manuscripts on public sites. Once manuscripts have been accepted for
> publication by IEEE, an author is required to post an IEEE copyright
> notice on his preprint. Upon publication, the author must replace the
> preprint with either 1) the full citation to the IEEE work with
> Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) or a link to the paper’s abstract in
> IEEE Xplore, or 2) the accepted version only (not the IEEE published
> version), including the IEEE copyright notice and full citation, with
> a link to the final, published paper in IEEE Xplore.

## What about Plan-S?

[Plan-S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) only relates to open access of papers via the publisher, not preprints or other open practices such as open materials or open data. It can, however, impact which publisher you choose.
