To make visualization research more broadly accessible, more scrutinizable, and more reproducible, VIS encourages openness and transparency in all facets of submitted work. 
Comprehensive guidelines for open practices of visualization research are currently being developed, and will be communicated in future years. 
For now, authors of all accepted papers are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline.
