Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the
research community, practitioners, and the general public. This accessibility can be improved if authors post the final version of their accepted paper to a reliable open access repository. VIS can facilitate an increase in sharing of papers by informing authors of this option, establishing guidelines for which repositories are freely accessible and reliable, helping authors use those repositories, and dispelling misconceptions.

This page informs VIS authors of their ability to post the final preprint version of their accepted article to an open access repository before the print deadline on August 1st.  In addition, this page provides instructions for posting to arXiv, a commonly used preprint repository that complies with IEEE copyright regulations.
