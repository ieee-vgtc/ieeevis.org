The **IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)** is the leading international conference dedicated to 
advances in visual analytics. Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by highly interactive visual interfaces.
People use visual analytics tools and techniques in all aspects of science, engineering, business, and government to synthesize 
information into knowledge; derive insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data; detect the expected and discover the 
unexpected; provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments; and communicate assessments effectively for action. 
The issues stimulating this body of research provide a grand challenge in science: turning information overload into a significant 
opportunity. Visual analytics requires interdisciplinary science, going beyond traditional scientific and information visualization 
to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and perceptual sciences, 
decision sciences, and more. Your submission should help develop and/or apply visual analytics, clearly showing an interdisciplinary 
approach.

Following the successful two-track arrangement in previous years, IEEE VAST 2019 will again feature an expanded set of accepted papers 
in two categories:

* ***TVCG* Track**: Papers that exhibit the highest quality in terms of originality, rigor and significance will appear in a special 
issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). The acceptance rate is anticipated to be similar to that 
of past years (around 22%-25%), subject to the decisions resulting from the review process. After initial notification of review 
results, conditionally accepted papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and review cycle in order to ensure 
that they are acceptable for publication and presentation in the journal. The paper and supplemental material will also be submitted 
to the IEEE Digital Library, subject to its standard terms and conditions.

* **Conference-only Track**:Top quality and timely, innovative VAST submissions may be accepted for the conference-only track. 
Those papers, which feature new contributions, will be presented as Conference Papers during IEEE VAST, and will be included on the 
IEEE VIS USB Proceedings. After initial notification of review results, conditionally accepted papers (including supplemental material) 
will undergo a revision and approval cycle. The paper and supplemental material will be submitted to the IEEE Digital Library subject 
to its standard terms and conditions.

## Topics

Research contributions are welcomed across a range of topics including, but not limited to:

* Visual representations and interaction techniques including the principles for depicting information, new visual paradigms, 
statistical graphics, geospatial visualizations, the science of interaction, and approaches for generating visual analytic 
visualization and interactions.
* Data management and knowledge representation including scalable data representations for high volume and stream data, statistical 
and semantic signatures, and synthesis of information from diverse data sources.
* Mathematical foundations and algorithms for data transformations such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep 
learning techniques to support interactive visual analysis.
* Analytical reasoning including the human analytic discourse, knowledge discovery methods, perception and cognition, and 
collaborative visual analytics.
* Presentation, production, and dissemination methods including methods and tools for capturing the analytics process, methods 
for elicitation of stakeholder constraints, priorities & processes for incorporation in analysis, and storytelling for specific 
and varying audiences.
* Applications of visual analysis techniques, including but not limited to applications in science, engineering, humanities, 
business, public safety, commerce, and logistics as far as they contribute to visual analytics are of particular interest.
* Evaluation methods, visual ethical analysis such as privacy, security, & regulatory compliance, interoperability, and technology 
practice & experience.
* Devices and technologies which are fundamental for visual analytics, including user and device adaptivity, web interfaces and 
mobile or other novel devices.

## Paper Types
VIS papers often fall into one or many of five main categories: technique, system, design study, evaluation, or model. 
Although your main paper type has to be specified during the paper submission process, papers can include elements of more than one of 
these categories. In visual analytics, concepts, theories, algorithms, techniques, designs, systems, empirical studies and 
applications normally create a context where analysis, visualization and interaction are integrated to optimize the combination of 
human and machine capabilities. It is this context that differentiates VAST from other conferences in VIS, while data involved can be 
spatial or non-spatial, techniques can be human-centric or machine-centric, and the application domain can be almost any academic 
discipline, industry, business sector, or governmental operation. Within such a context, an individual VAST paper may give a strong 
focus on an aspect where novel contributions reside, or place its emphasis on the integration of different aspects.

### Paper Type: Technique & Algorithm
A technique paper introduces a novel technique or algorithm that has not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly extends known techniques or algorithms. The technique or algorithm description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent graduate student in visualization could implement the work, and the authors should create a prototype implementation of the methods. This technique should ideally be of general application rather than being restricted to a single task or single source of data, and the exposition should be focused on what the technique does, how it does it, the tasks and datasets for which this new method is appropriate, and what the computational and other costs are. Evaluation is likely to strengthen technique papers.

VAST 2015 Best Paper


### Paper Type: System
A system paper describes a solution to a problem where the major task is building a large complex software artifact, applying largely known visualization techniques. The system that is described is both novel and important, and has been implemented. Here, the focus should be on the design decisions, the implications for software / hardware structure, and comparison with other systems. The comparison includes specific discussion of how the described system differs from and is, in some significant respects, superior to those systems.

VAST 2015 Honorable Mention.

### Paper Type: Application & Design Study
An application or design study paper explores the choices made when applying visualization and visual analytics techniques in an application area, for example relating the visual encodings and interaction techniques to the requirements of the target task. These papers typically include an encapsulated description of a problem domain and the questions to be resolved by visualization, then describes the application of visualization to the task, any novel techniques developed, and how the visualization solution answered the questions posed. The results of the study, including insights generated in the application domain and visualization knowledge generated through the research process, should be clearly conveyed. The work will be judged by the design lessons learned or insights gleaned for visualization research -- which may or may not include novel visualization techniques, algorithms, or systems -- on which future contributors can build. We invite submissions on any application area.

### Paper Type: Empirical Study
An empirical study paper explores the usage of visualization and visual analytics by people, and presents a study, either qualitative or quantitative, of visualization techniques or systems. The research contribution will be judged on the validity and importance of the results, including where appropriate, the definition of hypotheses, tasks, data sets, the rigorous collection and examination/analysis/coding of data, the selection of subjects and cases, as well as validation, discussion and conclusions.

VAST 2015 Honorable Mention.

### Paper Type: Theory & Model
A theory or model paper presents new interpretations of the foundational theory of visualization and visual analytics, including models, typologies or taxonomies of the design, development, evaluation, or use of visualization in particular contexts. These papers do not require implementation, but contribute by illuminating how visualization techniques complement and exploit properties of human vision and cognition, as well as how researchers conduct effective and rigorous visualization studies.
