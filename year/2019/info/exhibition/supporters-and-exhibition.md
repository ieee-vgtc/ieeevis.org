## Why Support and Exhibit at IEEE VIS

* Meet over 1,000 conference participants – potential customers and collaborators – leading researchers from government, industry, and academia from around the world that specialize in visual data representation and analysis.

* Gain first hand access to highly talented and skilled individuals for recruitment into your product development and research teams. Many of the conference participants are job seeking senior doctoral candidates and postdoctoral research fellows. There will be a virtual job fair to match jobseekers with employers, where gold, platinum, and diamond supporters are given priority.

* Increase visibility among conference attendees with an exhibit. The 2019 exhibits will be held in high traffic areas to maximize the interaction between supporters and attendees. An exhibit gives the opportunity to promote your company through print, presentation, media, and personal contact. Exhibit days are October 22-24, 2019, the highest frequency days of the conference.


* In addition to exhibit space, platinum and diamond supporters will have a time slot to present their technologies and research in the official conference supporter track.

* Promote your company in the official conference materials. With your approval, your company name, logo, and website will be included in the conference proceedings, final program, and conference website. 

* Receive complimentary or reduced conference registrations enabling your company to reach potential customers and recruit potential candidates.

* Support an inclusivity and diversity initiative through donations that provide grants to diverse candidates and to parents to support childcare costs!
