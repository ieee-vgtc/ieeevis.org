VIS 2019 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools. 

We invite you to share your research, insights, and enthusiasm at IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), and IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis). The 2019 program will also feature a diverse range of symposia and co-located events, including Visualization in Practice, Visualization in Data Science, the VIS Arts Program, and data analysis Challenge competitions, as well as a new Application Spotlights track. 

For 2019, IEEE VIS will take place in Vancouver, one of Canada's most iconic tech cities. Part of the Cascadia Innovation Corridor and home to the Canadian IT Supercluster, Vancouver is also renowned for its scenic beauty, outdoor activities, and vibrant west-coast culture.
