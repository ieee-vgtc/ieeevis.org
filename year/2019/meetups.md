## <a name="vancouver"></a> Vancouver Data Vis Meetup

Monday, October 21    
7:00 PM - 9:00 PM
Location: BrainStation, 455 Granville St #400 · Vancouver, BC (walking distance from the convention centre)    
Organizers: Johanna Fulda   
Contact: [j.fulda@gmx.de](mailto:j.fulda@gmx.de)

We think this is a great opportunity for the international visitors to see what’s happening in Vancouver's Data Viz community, and for the locals (who might not be able to attend the conference) to get a glimpse of the latest research in that area.
 
Anybody who is willing to share their visualization work (research, projects, ideas) we'd love to see a 2-5 minute presentation from you!
Feel free to contact me, then we can talk about the details and I'll put you on the agenda - or just come by and we'll play it by ear.

We'll kick it off with those presentations and then should have enough time afterwards to network, ask follow-up questions, mingle and eat pizza.

[BrainStation](https://brainstation.io) will host us this time - many thanks!!

It's a great venue - and super conveniently close to the Convention Center, where the conference is at (5 minute walk)

## <a name="vis-newcomers"></a> VIS Newcomers 

Tuesday, October 22    
12:50PM - 2:20PM    
Location: Room 1    
Organizers: Jessica Hullman, Jaegul Choo, and Weiwei Cui    
Contact: [community@ieeevis.org](mailto:community@ieeevis.org)  

Attending VIS for the first time can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know any other attendees, it’s your first conference, or if you are new to visualization. The VIS Newcomers Meetup is a conference orientation and informal lunch intended for first-time VIS attendees, regardless of experience, from students to practitioners. This allows participants to meet other conference goers and learn various tips for attending VIS. The meetup will start with a short presentation containing conference tips. Following the presentation, meetup attendees will split into small groups led by experienced VIS attendees to continue discussions over lunch and get to know each other.

NOTE: Lunch is not prepaid, each meetup attendee pays for their own lunch.

For more activities outside of the Newcomers Meetup, or if you are unable to attend the meetup, please see Vis Buddies, a [Community](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/call-participation/community) program bringing together groups of new and old VIS attendees for additional activities outside of this meetup.

## <a name="vislies"></a> VisLies!

Tuesday, October 22    
12:30PM - 2:20PM    
Location: Room 8+15    
Organizer: Kenneth Moreland and Bernice Rogowitz    
Contact: [kmorel@sandia.gov](mailto:kmorel@sandia.gov), [bernice.e.rogowitz@gmail.com](mailto:bernice.e.rogowitz@gmail.com)    
[Video Preview](https://vimeo.com/362329510)


VisLies! is a yearly event at IEEE VIS. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community. Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and ​insights that may one day save the world.

For more information about VisLies, you can visit our website at [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).

## <a name="climb-vis"></a> ClimbVis

Tuesday, October 22    
12:30PM - 2:20PM    
Location: Room 4    
Organizers: Kevin Allain    
Contact: [kevin.allain@city.ac.uk](mailto:kevin.allain@city.ac.uk)

The purpose of this event is to gather people participating in the VIS conference and share a great experience and healthy workout by going bouldering together!
We will discuss organisation and preparation more in depth with potentially interested people, with whom we would together head to a climbing centre later. 

No experience is necessary to join in! 

Climbing centres have walls paths designed for beginners as well as more challenging ones for those searching for a tougher workout. Concerning equipment, climbing centres have shoes that can be rented for a decent price, thus only comfortable clothes are necessary.

## <a name="openness"></a> Openness, Transparency, and Credibility in Visualization Research

Tuesday, October 22    
4:10PM - 5:40PM    
Location: Room 13    
Organizers: Lonni Besançon, André Calero Valdez, Fanny Chevalier, Michael Correll, Cody Dunne, Nils Gehlenborg, Lane Harrison, Steve Haroz, Jessica Hullman, Matthew Kay, Alvitta Ottley, Lace Padilla, Charles Perin, Arvind Satyanarayan, James Scott-Brown    
Contact: [steve.haroz@gmail.com](mailt:steve.haroz@gmail.com)

Many fields have faced a crisis of credibility due to failed replications. They have responded by rewarding and even requiring the sharing of any preregistrations, empirical data, and computational reproducibility materials that may have been produced in the course of research. Many journals in these fields have also increased the accessibility of publications, enabling a broader and more diverse set of readers and contributors. Unfortunately, visualization research has lagged behind the progress of other fields.

So let’s discuss how we can bootstrap the openness of our own research.
* Sharing empirical data: Are there legal or ethical issues? Are you unsure about the pros and cons of the various repositories?
* Preregistration: What is it? Are you unsure if it applies to your research? Or have you tried a preregistration but are unsure if it was clear?
* Replication and reproducibility: Are you unsure of the value of replication? Would you like to run a replication but aren’t sure how to start?
* Open Access: Do you have concerns about the accessibility of your publications?
* General: Have you made a mistake you think others could learn from? Do you have a success story you’d like to share?

Let’s discuss the many issues involved in learning a new approach to research and work together to improve the transparency, openness, and credibility of our work.

## <a name="junior-faculty"></a> Junior Faculty, Researchers, and Practitioners Happy Hour

Tuesday, October 22   
6:00PM - 8:00PM   
Location: Room 2+3    
Organizers: Kristi Potter and Remco Chang   
Contact: [kristi.potter@nrel.gov](mailto:kristi.potter@nrel.gov)   

Join your fellow junior-level faculty, researchers, and practitioners in our third annual happy hour!

The goal of this meetup is to provide a safe environment for junior Vis researchers to gather and discuss challenges faced in and out of the work environment. The VIS community has always been very supportive of its junior members, however, one missing link among these wide range of programs is support for the junior professors, early career researchers and practitioners.  Junior researchers face significant amount of pressure and are often overwhelmed by the drastic change from being a student (or a postdoc). Many junior researchers have little training in project management, grant-writing, mentoring, teaching, and establishing a research agenda. As a result, they struggle maintaining a work-life balance and have few (if no) outlet in seeking help, advice, or support. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet fellow early career researchers, participate in peer mentoring, and as a result build a social network (or a cohort) that will continue to support beyond the VIS conference.

## <a name="vis-jobfair"></a> VIS Job-fair meetup

Wednesday, October 23    
2:20PM - 3:50PM    
Location: Exhibit Hall A    
Organizers: Jessica Hullman, Jaegul Choo, and Weiwei Cui    
Contact: [community@ieeevis.org](mailto:community@ieeevis.org)    
[Video Preview](https://vimeo.com/362329572)


As a complement to the <b>Asynchronous Job Fair</b>, we are organizing a job “speed-dating” meetup. Its goal is to bring together job seekers and employers in one venue to trade CV and employment information. Both job seekers and employers should attend with the expectation to be prepared with “low-tech” information, such as paper and flyers to exchange. If you are an interested job seeker, please bring your contact information to share, such as printed CVs, email addresses on notecards or business cards, for example. Likewise for employers, please be prepared with business cards, brochures, and other paper-based information.

## <a name="open-practices"></a> Open Practices at VIS: journey so far and moving forward

Wednesday, October 23    
2:20PM - 3:50PM    
Location: Room 13    
Organizers: Cagatay Turkay    
Contact: [cagatay.turkay@city.ac.uk](mailto:cagatay.turkay@city.ac.uk)

VIS now has an Open Practices agenda and recruited Open Practices Chairs to help shape the process together with the visualization community. This meetup will be an open discussion where we discuss the opportunities, challenges and ways forward for making visualisation research more open and freely accessible in the coming years. The organizers will briefly share an overview of the first steps taken along this agenda so far in this first year, and then the meeting will follow with a discussion where everyone voices their views and concerns. The plan is to take these points on board and share more widely to inform any further planning done along the open practices agenda.

## <a name="diversity"></a> Viewpoints on Diversity through the VIS history

Thursday, October 24    
4:10 PM - 5:40 PM    
Location: Room 14    
Organizer: Alexandra Diehl, Johanna Schmidt, Renato Pajarola    
Contact: [diehl@ifi.uzh.ch](mailto:diehl@ifi.uzh.ch)    
[Video Preview](https://vimeo.com/362329439)


There has been a long journey since 1991, the time of the first visualization symposium, until today. Since then, the VIS community has grown up in different ways. In this meetup, we would like to learn and share information and experiences about how this community developed in terms of diversity. We also would like to share useful resources and information to promote diversity in the visualization and scientific environment, exploring current challenges, and potential actions to increase diversity. In a previous meetup, at VIS in 2017, we addressed career paths for women in the visualization field. Now, we want to expand the scope of this meetup to other kinds of diversity including gender, but also geography, scientific background, age, and ethnicity. Our main goal is to wrap-up the history of diversity in VIS from its beginning until today. As a second goal, we would like to give the opportunity to the participants to share common experiences, to learn more about useful resources, and support and endorsement programs. The meetup is considered to accompany other activities and initiatives currently undertaking by the VIS conference to increase diversity. We hope that participants will get to know each other better, to share good advice in terms of reducing the ties, and to increase the heterogeneity of our VIS scientific community. If you would like to actively contribute to the meetup program to share your personal experiences, please let the organizers know.
