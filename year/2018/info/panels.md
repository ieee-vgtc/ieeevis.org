## <a name="succeeding"></a> [Succeeding by Failing: The Iceberg in VIS Careers](http://www.luanamicallef.com/succeedingbyfailing)
Tuesday, Oct 23: 2:20-4:00pm
Estrel C

Luana Micallef, Iniversity of Copenhagen

Tatiana von Landesberger, TU Darmstadt

Carla C. Schubert

The academic competitive environment and its ‘acceptance & rejection’ culture lead to high pressure and stress for researchers at all career stages. We will discuss such threats, coping mechanisms and ways how our community can help. Example topics include: work-life balance, dealing with rejections, providing supportive reviews, funding pressures, career prospects in times of uncertainty, and many more topics depending on the audience. Our panelists include: visualization professors with diverse expertise and seniority levels, and a psychologist/psychotherapist who also conducts research and treats academics with related psychological problems. Voice your first-hand experiences, questions and comments anonymously at [http://www.luanamicallef.com/succeedingbyfailing](http://www.luanamicallef.com/succeedingbyfailing) and participate in our follow-up meetup!


## <a name="PerspectivesColor"></a> Perspectives in Color Research for Scientific Visualization: Understanding the Lenses and Languages
Wednesday, Oct 24: 2:20-4:00pm
Estrel Rm IV

Francesca Samsel, University of Texas at Austin

Roxana Bujack, Los Alamos National Laboratory

Lyn Bartram, Simon Fraser University

Karen Schloss, University of Wisconsin

Gerik Scheuermann, Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University

To date most of the design, construction, and evaluation of colormaps and tools have been developed within individual disciplines. Our panelists bring expertise that originates outside of computer science disciplines onto the visualization challenges. Each panelist will introduce their field, expertise, and its potential to contribute to scientific visualization. The panel has been designed to address our broader goals: highlighting a range of expertise beyond computer science; creating language toward common terminology to facilitate dialogue; listening to and understanding the domain sciences needs; and identifying opportunities for collaborative research avenues.


## <a name="founders"></a> Meet the Founders: How to Start and Sustain a Business in the Visualization Space
Thursday, Oct 25: 2:20-4:00pm
Estrel Rm IV

Robert Kosara, Tableau Research

Lisa Avila, Kitware

Jeffrey Heer, University of Washington

Anders Ynnerman, Linköping University
 
Visualization is not just an academic pursuit, there are also a number of successful companies that have come out of visualization research or are closely related. This panel brings together some of the founders of these companies to discuss how start a small business based on research and how to sustain and keep building it as a business. We will talk about what were good and bad decisions, what was easier and harder than expected, and be open to questions from anybody who might be considering starting their own (or is just curious).
