## <a name="vis-newcomers"></a> VIS Newcomers 

Sunday, OCTOBER 21  
12:50PM - 1:20PM  
Location: Estrel Room II

Organizers: Anastasia Bezerianos, Jonathan Woodring and Weiwei Cui    
Contact: [community@ieeevis.org](mailto:community@ieeevis.org)  

Attending VIS for the first time can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know any other attendees, it’s your first conference, or if you are new to visualization. The VIS Newcomers Meetup is a conference orientation and informal lunch intended for first-time VIS attendees, regardless of experience, from students to practitioners. This allows participants to meet other conference goers and learn various tips for attending VIS. The meetup will start with a short presentation containing conference tips. Following the presentation, meetup attendees will split into small groups led by experienced VIS attendees to continue discussions over lunch and get to know each other.

NOTE: Lunch is not prepaid, each meetup attendee pays for their own lunch. 

For more activities outside of the Newcomers Meetup, or if you are unable to attend the meetup, please see Vis Buddies, a [Community](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/call-participation/community) program bringing together groups of new and old VIS attendees for additional activities outside of this meetup.

## <a name="vislies"></a> VisLies!

Tuesday, October 23 
12:30PM - 2:00PM    
Location: Room 30310


Organizer: Kenneth Moreland and Bernice Rogowitz    
Contact: [kmorel@sandia.gov](mailto:kmorel@sandia.gov), [bernice.e.rogowitz@gmail.com](mailto:bernice.e.rogowitz@gmail.com)

Please join us on Tuesday for VisLies. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community. Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and a deeper sense of responsibility that may one-day impact the world.

Make VisLies more fun for yourself and everyone else by sharing your favorite (or most delpored) ways to misrepresent data. If you have examples to present at VisLies, please visit our web site: [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).

## <a name="careers"></a> Follow-up meetup to the panel 'Succeeding by Failing: The Iceberg in VIS Careers'

Tuesday, October 23 
4:20PM - 6:00PM   
Location: Room 30312

Organizers:  Luana Micallef and Tatiana von Landesberger  
Contact: [lm@di.ku.dk](mailto:lm@di.ku.dk), [tatiana.von.landesberger@gris.tu-darmstadt.de](mailto:tatiana.von.landesberger@gris.tu-darmstadt.de)

We will continue discussing the challenges we encounter in VIS careers and ways how our community can help. This is your chance to share your experiences with peers and to contribute to the suggestions we will put forward to the VIS steering committees to nurture a welcoming and supportive atmosphere in our highly competitive work culture. We hope that these suggestions we help the steering committees reflect on the changes that need to be made during the restructuring process of our community. Everyone (be it students, postdocs, professors, researchers from academia or industry) is welcome to join! This will also help us initiate a support network for the VIS community whereby we can help each out with the various challenges and pressures we encounter at different stages of our careers (e.g., dealing with rejections and career uncertainties, getting funding, finding a balance between work and our personal life, coping with stress). If you cannot attend but you still want to voice your opinion, then post your questions and comments anonymously at [http://www.luanamicallef.com/succeedingbyfailing/](http://www.luanamicallef.com/succeedingbyfailing/)

## <a name="junior-faculty"></a> Junior Faculty, Researchers, and Practitioners Happy Hour

Tuesday, October 23 
6:00PM - 8:00PM   
Location: Estrel Hall A

Organizers: Kristi Potter and Remco Chang   
Contact: [kristi.potter@nrel.gov](mailto:kristi.potter@nrel.gov)   

Join your fellow junior-level faculty, researchers, and practitioners in our first ever happy hour!

The goal of this meetup is to provide a safe environment for junior Vis researchers to gather and discuss challenges faced in and out of the work environment. The VIS community has always been very supportive of its junior members, however, one missing link among these wide range of programs is support for the junior professors, early career researchers and practitioners.  Junior researchers face significant amount of pressure and are often overwhelmed by the drastic change from being a student (or a postdoc). Many junior researchers have little training in project management, grant-writing, mentoring, teaching, and establishing a research agenda. As a result, they struggle maintaining a work-life balance and have few (if no) outlet in seeking help, advice, or support. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet fellow early career researchers, participate in peer mentoring, and as a result build a social network (or a cohort) that will continue to support beyond the VIS conference.

## <a name="visrocks"></a> VisRocks!

Wednesday, October 24 
5:20PM - 6:20PM   
Location: Room 30310

Organizers: Michael Sedlmair, Jean-Daniel Fekete    
Contact: [Michael.Sedlmair@visus.uni-stuttgart.de](mailto:Michael.Sedlmair@visus.uni-stuttgart.de), [Jean-Daniel.Fekete@inria.fr](mailto:Jean-Daniel.Fekete@inria.fr)   

Many VIS researchers are playing music. Since the parties at VIS are fun and attract many participants and their friends to the conference, as of 2019 we are planning to add another style of party where VIS researchers will entertain their colleagues by playing some music, and thus add to the fun. We expect that VisRocks will allow all generations of VIS musicians to play together and facilitate connections in a relaxed atmosphere.

We invite everybody to the meetup who reflects with this idea. E.g., you might be an individual musician who would potentially like to play at such an event, you might already have a (partial) band of VIS folks, or you are not playing music yourself but would like to get involved in organizing VisRocks. Our current idea of VisRocks is to solicit a diverse set of musical styles, such as novel musical pieces, covers of existing pieces, or covers with transformed lyrics. But nothing is set in stone yet and we would love to discuss with you on how to go forward.

## <a name="inclusion"></a> Building an Inclusive VIS Community

Thursday, October 25  
10:40AM - 11:40AM   
Location: Room 30310

Organizers: Michelle Borkin, Kelly Gaither, R. Jordan Crouser, and Meg Pirrung    
Contact: [m.borkin@northeastern.edu](mailto:m.borkin@northeastern.edu)   

Diversity of perspective is the key to innovation, but ensuring equal access requires concrete action. To this end, the members of the IEEE VIS 2018 Inclusivity & Diversity Committee invite you to this community forum to connect, share your experiences, and explore what it means to build an inclusive VIS community. (To learn more about Inclusivity & Diversity at VIS and its current initiatives, please visit: [http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/inclusion-and-diversity/inclusivity](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/inclusion-and-diversity/inclusivity))

## <a name="vis-jobfair"></a> VIS Job-fair meetup

Thursday, October 25  
4:10PM - 6:00PM   
Location: Estrel Room IV

Organizers: Anastasia Bezerianos, Jonathan Woodring and Weiwei Cui    
Contact: community@ieeevis.org	

As a complement to the <b>Asynchronous Job Fair</b>, we are organizing a job “speed-dating” meetup. Its goal is to bring together job seekers and employers in one venue to trade CV and employment information. Both job seekers and employers should attend with the expectation to be prepared with "low-tech" information, such as paper and flyers to exchange. If you are an interested job seeker, please bring your contact information to share, such as printed CVs, email addresses on notecards or business cards, for example. Likewise for employers, please be prepared with business cards, brochure, and other paper-based information.

## <a name="visap"></a> VISAP’18 workshop: Data visualizations with a strong identity 

Thursday, October 25  
4:20PM - 6:00PM   
Location: Room 30310

Organizers: Caroline Goulard, Ludovic Riffault    
Contact: [contact@dataveyes.com](mailto:contact@dataveyes.com)

Whatever your dataset is about, visual metaphors are a great help to build visualizations of data that embody the subject. The purpose of this workshop is to show to participants the power of visual forms, but also their complexity. Indeed, for a single representation, users can associate different connotations, which totally change the identity of the project. Same thing for a pattern, that can be read in various ways (as in the Rorschach test). Together with the participants we will have a playful workshop, figuring out the associations of spontaneous ideas caused by visualizations, and the possibilities to render a particular subject based on real data.

## <a name="vision-science"></a> Visualization Meets Vision Science

Thursday, October 25  
6:00PM - 7:00PM   
Location: Conv 1, Sec D

Organizers: Madison Elliott, Zoya Bylinskii, Christine Nothelfer, Cindy Xiong and Danielle Albers Szafir    
Contact: [danielle.szafir@colorado.edu](mailto:danielle.szafir@colorado.edu)   

Vision science provides both an empirical basis for techniques and design practices in visualization and a suite of methods and approaches for understanding visualizations---including what data trends people see, what statistics they extract, and what they ultimately remember. Visualization provides a real world platform for vision scientists to investigate how our perceptual and cognitive systems interpret visualized information and problems for understanding how we transform visual information to knowledge. Come meet with visualization and vision science experts to share cutting edge research at this growing interdisciplinary intersection! We will engage in lightning talks and open discussion, which provide an opportunity to ask questions, share new research ideas, and extend your professional networks. All are welcome, and interested presenters can submit an abstract for a 2-3 minute "lightning talk" about their latest work by September 21, 2018.

## <a name="diversity"></a> Broadening Intellectual Diversity of Visualization Research Papers

Thursday, October 25  
6:00PM - 7:00PM   
Location: Estrel Room IV

Organizers:  Bongshin Lee, Liz Marai, Danielle Albers Szafir, Kate Isaacs, Cagatay Turkay, and Sheelagh Carpendale    
Contact: [bongshin@microsoft.com](mailto:bongshin@microsoft.com)  

This meetup is being proposed as a follow-up discussion session to the breakout group
discussion at the BIRS Workshop, “Restructuring VIS for the Future,” held in June 2018. 
In this meetup, we will discuss broader types of contributions with aims to promote a healthy growth of the visualization community, to increase intellectual diversity, and to better demonstrate the value and impact of visualization research. We fully acknowledge the value of the paper types (Munzner, 2008) to the community so far (in particular to the paper writing and reviewing process). However, we also note that paper types specify mostly the paper structure due to their prescriptive nature. Contribution types can give a broader scope to the types of papers that are considered acceptable (e.g., exciting and emerging research that does not fit exactly into a paper type) and can offer more transient and flexible criteria to evaluate visualization research. 
To facilitate initial discussion, we will provide a set of research contribution types with example papers, along with a brief review of contribution types in other research communities. While this would not be exhaustive it would serve as a good starting point. 
We will discuss the concrete next steps we can and should take to ensure a successful implantation and application of the research contribution types. We also plan to continue our discussion and communication with the meetup participants through a Slack channel.

## <a name="food"></a> Good Food Meets Good Science

Thursday, October 25  
7:00PM   
Location: Restaurant "Zur Gerichtslaube", Poststraße 28, D-10178 Berlin

Organizers: Daniel Archambault, Andreas Kerren    
Contact: [d.w.archambault@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:d.w.archambault@swansea.ac.uk)

Tired of bad food? Didn’t have something local when attending the conference and regretted it? Want the good scientific discussions to continue around a local specialty of the area?
This meetup is designed to take participants to a restaurant serving good food that is a local specialty of the area. We aim for an accessible price so that anyone can attend.  People can sign up (see below) on a first come first served basis.  The audience should bring an interesting scientific topic to discuss at dinner. An appetite for local cuisine is also highly recommended.
