Berlin is full of extraordinary places. Collecting all of them is simply
impossible. Some of the VIS 2018 organizers either live in Berlin or
visit the town regularly. They have their own personal favourite spots
in Berlin. On this web site, they share them with the VIS community.

Once in Berlin, I often visit the "Kulturbrauerei". Originally built as
a huge brewery in the 19th century, it is nowadays a cultural center
including several concert halls, theatres, cinemas, clubs and bars. I
remember several concerts of some of my favourite bands taking place
here in recent years.

One of my favorite places in Berlin is the Museum Berggruen. There you
can find works of Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Henri Matisse and Alberto
Giacometti from the private collection of Heinz Berggruen.  I like the
building and the beautiful pictures. Also the story of Heinz Berggruen
is very interesting and touching.

Things to do:
1. If the weather is nice, a boat trip on the spree is nice to see a lot
of the city. Maybe start at the beautiful Schloss Charlottenburg and
float along the Bundestag, the Museumsinsel, the Eastside Gallery and
other important and areas and sights of Berlin.
2. On a sunday, go see the huge flee market at Berlin Mauerpark. You can
by anything from art to food to instruments to whatever you can imagine.
The park is lovely to just lay down and relax, listen to people
attending the huge open air karaoke and eat one of the huge variety of
dishes you can get there.
3. The Teufelsberg is the second highest hill in Berlin and was once a
radar station.
     If the old main building is open (which it might not be :/ )
it's an
interesting visit with street art and a view over the city.
4. The Spreepark Plänterwald was once the only amusement park in the DDR
and was abandoned a long time ago. You can still find the old
attractions lying around (dinosaurs, ferris wheels, rollercoaster,
etc.) .
5. If you want to know, how many Berlin people spend their free time, go
and relax at the Tempelhofer Feld, a former airport.
6. Go see the POIs: Eastside Gallery, Brandenburger Gate, Fernsehturm,
Reichstag, Siegessäule, etc. - It can all be done easily by foot or by
getting a hop on hop off bus ticket.
That's it in terms of touristic things to do and see.
When it comes to bars etc. it's all about location.
Most of the bars I would recommend are unfortunately not close to the
conference Hotel.
