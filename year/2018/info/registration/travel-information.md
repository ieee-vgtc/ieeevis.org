## <a name='public-transport'></a>Public transport
Berlin has a public transportation infrastructure providing diverse modes of urban mobility. There is the metro (S-Bahn) and the suburban railway system (U-Bahn), buses, trams and ferries. The S-Bahn is operated by Deutsche Bahn, the other transport systems by BVG. They are joined together in a traffic network (VBB), with a common tariff and ticket system.

The city of Berlin and the surrounding suburbs are divided into three tariff zones:
- Zone A is Berlin's inner city up to and including the S-Bahn ring.
- Zone B is outside the S-Bahn ring up to the city boundary; Airport Berlin Tegel TXL is located in this zone.
- Zone C is the outside of Berlin (approx. 15 km around the city of Berlin), including the Airport Berlin Schönefeld SFX and the city of Potsdam.

You can buy tickets for the combined zones AB, BC or ABC, as needed. Additionally there are short-distance tickets, valid for a journey of 3 stations with the S- or U-Bahn (with transfer possibility) or of up to 6 stops with bus or tram (without transfer possibility).

Tickets are valid for all public transport in Berlin: S-Bahn, U-Bahn, buses, trams and ferries. Adults pay a regular fare (AB: 2.80 euros, BC: 3.10 euros, ABC: 3.40 euros); the reduced fare is valid for children aged 6 to 14. Children under 6 do not need tickets. There are a number of [further ticket options](https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/tickets) (4-trip tickets, day passes, group tickets, ...) and also [tourist tickets](https://www.berlin-welcomecard.de/en) (Berlin Welcome Card).

For route planning you will most likely use some online app (which is also recommended in view of the complexity of the transport network in Berlin). Maps (U-Bahn, S-Bahn) can be downloaded here: [route map of Berlin](https://berlinmap360.com/carte/pdf/en/berlin-u-bahn-map.pdf), [route map of Greater Berlin](https://sbahn.berlin/fileadmin/user_upload/Liniennetz/S_U-Bahn-Netz.pdf).
More detailed information can be found at the [BVG webpage](https://www.bvg.de/en) (U-Bahn, bus, tram, ferries) and the [S-Bahn webpage](https://sbahn.berlin/).
