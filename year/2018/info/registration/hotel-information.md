In 2018, IEEE VIS takes place at <a href="http://www.estrel.com/en/home.html">Estrel Hotel & Congress Center</a> in Berlin,  Germany. Estrel Berlin is Germany’s largest hotel and it is connected with several spacious and modern conference rooms.

The conference rate is €138/night for single occupancy and €150/night for double occupancy (including tax, not including breakfast). The cutoff date for reservations under this rate is July 27, 2018. After this date, we cannot guarantee availability of the hotel rooms for the specified conditions.

Staying in the conference hotel has a lot of advantages not only for the participants. Having occupied many rooms improves renting conditions of the conference facilities and is therefore good for the whole conference. In particular, it may allow better onsite food and beverage covering. Because of this, we ask you to book the hotel only via the link below.

In order to make a reservation at Estrel Berlin under the conference rate, click the reservation button.

The Estrel Hotel and Congress Center is located in the district Berlin-Neukölln. Neukölln is a part of Berlin with international flair. In the past few years, northern Neukölln has undergone a transformation and has seen a huge influx of students and artists as the area becomes increasingly popular. Close to the conference hotel, there are plenty of restaurants. All important tourist attractions in Berlin can be reached by public transportation within a few minutes.

Berlin is a vibrant city and one of the most interesting cities in Europe. It offers many cultural highlights, touristic sightseeing as well as plenty of restaurants and entertainment around.

Berlin is well connected with all major airlines. It is well reachable from all over the world. The local public transport network consists of several integrated systems. These include the U-Bahn and S-Bahn urban rail systems, regional railway services, a tramway system, a bus network and a number of ferry services.

Finally, despite being a hotspot, hotel and restaurant prices are still rather affordable in Berlin.
