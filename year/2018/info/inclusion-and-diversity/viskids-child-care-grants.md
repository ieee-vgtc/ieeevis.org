The VIS conference is excited to support our VISKids and young families!

Grants of up to $500 per family are available for VIS attendees who are bringing small children to the conference or who incur extra expenses in leaving their children at home. The grants will be given as a reimbursement for expenses but attendees are responsible for making their own arrangements for child care. If requests exceed available funding, or if additional funding becomes available, preference will be given to students and early career attendees who are presenting at the conference.
 
### Examples of allowable expenses

* Home-based babysitting or child care services incurred because of
  attendance at the conference.
* Babysitting or child care services on location in the city of the
  conference.
* Expenses incurred in bringing a caregiver (or family member not
  attending the meeting acting as a caregiver) to the meeting. This
  includes airfare/train fare and hotel expenses.
* Travel expenses for the child, limited to reimbursement of
  airfare/train fare.
  
### Not eligible for reimbursement

* Travel or other expenses related to the attendeeâ€™s participation in
  the meeting, including meeting registration, meals, travel to the
  meeting (including private automobile mileage or tolls), or other
  expenses the attendee would already be incurring by attending the
  meeting. 
* Meals for the child, toys, and tickets to museums, amusement parks,
  etc.
* On-going home-based child care expenses.

### Reimbursement procedure

* Recipients of a child care grant must submit receipts for
  reimbursable expenses.

specific childcare providers, and does not assume responsibility or
liability for childcare services of any sort. It is the responsibility
