Visualization taps into the very best capabilities of our brains, transforming fundamentally abstract numerical data into something that communicates and illuminates information ranging from the simple to the complex. Visualization researchers, developers, practitioners, and educators routinely work across traditional discipline boundaries, oftentimes in teams of people that come from a diverse blend of backgrounds, using visualizations as a common language for collaboration. As a community, we are native interdisciplinary thinkers, working at the intersection of science, art, engineering, and technology. 

Promoting and fostering inclusion is important to IEEE VIS. This year, the IEEE VIS community is providing opportunities to underrepresented groups as well as educating the community on the benefits of a more inclusive culture and programming. Acknowledging the uniqueness of each individual, IEEE VIS seeks to cultivate an environment that encourages freedom of expression. As part of our efforts, we are proud to announce a variety of meetups, workshops and panels that are focused on inclusion and diversity.

Inclusivity Content at IEEE VIS 2018 will also include meetup events focused around inclusivity, awareness in our community, and family through VISKids events and meet-ups.
