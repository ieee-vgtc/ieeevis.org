IEEE VIS 2018 Panels should address important and/or controversial applications and issues in visualization and its subfields today. In particular, we invite panels that:
* Connect visualization with interesting application fields.
* Bring researchers together with potential users of visualization
* Consist of experts in fields that might teach us important concepts (e.g., perceptual psychology, visual design, color theory, user-interface design)
* Raise controversial, important, or emerging issues in the field of visualization.
 
Panelists should be experts in their fields who can discuss the challenges of visualization, and engage the audience and fellow panel members in a stimulating, interactive debate. 

VIS Panels value diversity in perspective, opinion, and representation. The most interesting sessions are the ones where there are many different perspectives. In selecting panels, the committee will favor panels that reflect the breadth and richness of the VIS community.  In curating a panel, we urge you to consider speakers that come from a variety of intellectual backgrounds, with diverse genders, ethnicities, and nationalities.

## PANEL LOGISTICS
Panels are scheduled for the duration of an entire paper session; panel proposals should thus target one hour and 40 minutes total duration, including question and discussion periods. We strongly recommend that in order to keep to time, the chair of the panel is not one of the panel speakers.

IEEE VIS videorecords and archives panels, making them available online. Many VIS participants, as well as people who cannot attend, have found these archived panels to be a valuable part of the process. Panel organizers may choose not to have the panels made available to the public.

## SUBMISSIONS
Panel proposals should describe the topic to be addressed and identify the prospective panelists. Each panelist should include a position statement on the topic and a short biography, the total of which should be limited to 500 words for each panelist, up to a maximum of four pages for the whole panel. In case the panel follows up on the topic of a previously held panel, we ask the organizers to point this out and to detail the advances expected from the follow-up. 

Panel organizers should also submit a short description of the panel format and schedule (max. 1 page). This should be in a separate document from the proposal itself, and should describe the order of topics to be discussed, time to be spent on panelist presentations, and mechanisms for encouraging audience participation. Based on audience feedback, the duration of panelist presentations should allow ample time for intra-panel discussion and discussions between the panel and the audience.

We note that submitting similar topics to multiple venues (e.g., panels and workshops) is likely to result in at most one accepted proposal so that a broad range of topics can be presented at the conference.

Submissions should be submitted via [PCS](http://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc/). Please note the [formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) when preparing your submission. 

Feel free to address any questions concerning submission, format, and content to [panels@ieeevis.org](mailto:panels@ieeevis.org).

## PAST PANELS
Panels will be recorded and posted to Vimeo for archival viewing. Panels from 2017 can be found at [http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/panels](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/panels).
