The IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis) Conference solicits novel
research ideas and innovative applications in all areas of scientific
visualization. The scope of the conference, co-located at VIS with the
annual IEEE Visual Analytics and IEEE Information Visualization
Conferences, includes both fundamental research contributions within
scientific visualization, as well as advances towards understanding or
solving real world problems, or that impact a particular application
in a significant way.

Please note that topics focused on visual analytics, e.g.,
computational solutions facilitated by visual interfaces to support
analysis, might be a better match for the IEEE VAST Conference at IEEE
VIS. Similarly, topics which clearly focus on information
visualization, e.g., graphical representation of abstract data to aid
cognition, might be a better match for the IEEE InfoVis Conference,
also at IEEE VIS. Papers chairs reserve the right to move papers
between conferences based on its topic and perceived fit.

## Paper Types

### Paper Type: Technique

A **technique** paper describes a new or significantly improved
algorithm or technique in sufficient detail so that other researchers
can reproduce the results. This technique should ideally be of general
application rather than being restricted to a single task or single
source of data, and the exposition should be focused on what the
technique does, how it does it, when to use it, and what the
computational and other costs are.

### Paper Type: System

A **system** paper describes a solution to a problem where the major
task is building a large complex software artifact, applying largely
known visualization techniques. Here, the focus should be on the
design decisions, the implications for software / hardware structure,
and comparison with other systems.

### Paper Type: Application

An **application** paper normally starts with an encapsulated
description of a problem domain and the questions to be resolved by
visualization, then describes the application of visualization to the
task, any novel techniques developed, and how the visualization
solution answered the questions posed. Techniques related to a single
problem are normally application papers, and evaluation is often
limited because many application papers are essentially custom
software for a specific problem.

### Paper Type: Evaluation 

An **evaluation** paper is usually an empirical assessment of how
effective a technique or system is when used by humans. As such, these
often involve rigorous experimental protocols and statistical
analysis, but this is not the only possible form of evaluation. Good
evaluation papers go beyond statistical analysis to explain causes,
construct models and predict effectiveness of related systems.

### Paper Type: Theory 

A **theory** paper describes aspects of the process by which humans construct visualizations to explore data or communicate with other humans. These papers do not usually involve implementation, but contribute by illuminating the role of visualization in data analysis and often by proposing models for improving visualization as a discipline.
