### The reVISe Committee (2019-ongoing)



The reVISe Committee was struck in February 2019 by the VEC (VIS Executive Committee), with the mandate of creating a concrete proposal for re-organizing the academic conferences (VAST, InfoVis, SciVis) under a single umbrella, including paper reviewing and governance. It meets weekly, and posts intermediate work products regularly including summarized meeting minutes and key findings. To contact the committee with feedback on any aspect of its work, please write to [revise@ieeevis.org](mailto:revise@ieeevis.org).
