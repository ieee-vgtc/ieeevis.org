## This script should be run only when a released is published *for the current year*.
##
## This action will build the entire site from scratch, taking ALL commits from *other*
##   branches as production-ready, and only checking out the current year's branch up to
##   the tagged release SHA.
##
## NOTE: only create releases on the latest branch (currently: vis2021).
##       e.g., `git checkout {sha}`, `git tag -a v2021.1.1 -m "v2021.1.1"`,
##             `git push --tags`, and then create a release in GitHub from that tag.
##
##
## This script is based on staging.yml.  The only differences:
## * the triggers are published releases, not any push to the repository
## * the initial checkout also gets available tags
## * the `release` event's tag is used to check out the current branch
##   (disregarding any commits made after the release was created)
## * the script deploys to production instead of staging
