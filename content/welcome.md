IEEE VIS 2026 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools.

In 2026, the conference returns to the United States, and we look forward to welcoming you to Boston, MA! Boston will be an especially exciting city to visit because 2026 marks the 250th anniversary of American independence—a milestone that the city helped spark through events like the Boston Tea Party. Today, Boston is a dynamic city, home to a rich ecosystem of world-class universities, vibrant tech and biotech companies, renowned cultural institutions, and world-champion sports teams. The conference will be hosted in the heart of the city: a beautiful tree- and brownstone-lined neighborhood called Back Bay. Walk to the magnificent Boston Public Library, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Get some fresh air along the Charles River Esplanade or the Emerald Necklace—a chain of public parks that span the city. Hop on the T (our subway system) and reach MIT, Harvard, Tufts, UMass Boston, Boston College, and Northeastern University within minutes. 

Boston will provide an inspiring backdrop for reconnecting with colleagues, sharing new ideas, and shaping the future of visualization together.
