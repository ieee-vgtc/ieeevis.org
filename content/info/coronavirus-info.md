**Updated 19 March 2020**

IEEE VIS 2020 is still scheduled to be held as planned in the Fall of 2020. However, we acknowledge that the situation is very dynamic, and we will continue to monitor events and update things accordingly. In particular, we have spent substantial time in the last few days to strike a reasonable balance between providing some immediate relief in terms of time and flexibility for the people already affected by the pandemic and the disruption that will inevitably happen in the following months. This message summarizes the final revision of the papers submission timeline that we have developed in response to the current situation.

**For Authors**: Although the main conference activities are some time away, we appreciate that some of our community are impacted as they attempt to prepare their paper submissions. We have deliberated on the various issues. In our attempt to balance authors’ considerations with reviewer challenges, review time-table, or challenges in the review process, we have decided to **extend** the abstract submission deadline to **20 April 2020**, and to extend the paper submission deadline to **30 April 2020**.

We are aware that these are uncertain times; however, this new deadline is definitive. An extension to 30 April 2020 is the latest we can possibly accommodate without impacting the quality of the review process and respecting the scientific standards of our field:  those that are authors on one side of the deadline are more than often reviewers on the other side of the deadline.

The InfoVis, SciVis and VAST Paper Chairs have put together a [letter to authors](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VZWlAl7gBQU1M9CuNU1cVdQXvp_Sa5MI). 

**For Reviewers, Committee Members, and Volunteers, etc.**:  We acknowledge that we are living in unprecedented times. Most countries have instituted social distancing policies, and this has, in turn, caused a re-evaluation of people’s commitments and priorities. In the best case, we have volunteers who are healthy but who need to adjust to accommodate new schedules.  In other cases, we have to plan for community members dealing with the health impacts of COVID-19.  In light of this, we are asking all volunteers to mindfully consider their ability to continue to participate in IEEE VIS 2020.  In the past, social pressure was used to persuade us to keep our commitments.  However, it is important for us as a community to be mindful and respectful of all who, for various reasons, need to inevitably prioritize other things over their IEEE VIS 2020 commitments.  There should be no stigma associated with having to reduce or eliminate your involvement in IEEE VIS during these challenging times. But equally, we see the importance of hope, and so we need to support efforts to continue with the conference and enable the community to participate in and publish research where we can.  We will correspondingly work with the various volunteer groups to try to engage more members of the community.  If any of us is no longer able to participate, please let the General Chairs (GCs) know.  To keep communication channels fast and efficient, the GCs will remain the primary channel for updated information.
 
The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our main priority. We will continue to monitor official travel advisories related to the COVID-19 and update the event website to keep you informed. We encourage you to check back with us concerning specific travel recommendations as the conference approaches.
 
This is a great community, and if you need to drop out for a while to prioritize other things, then you should do so with our sincerest best wishes.  At the same time, we appreciate the strong response across our community to see IEEE VIS through these challenging times by working together.
