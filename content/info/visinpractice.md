The **VisInPractice** associated event at **[IEEE VIS 2023](http://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome)** will feature two panels on the practice of visualization.

The **VisInPractice** program is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying data visualization and visual analytics to real use cases. Our goal is to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices in industry.

This year's VisinPractice will be an in-person event.

# Program

VisInPractice 2023 will be a half-day event taking place on Monday October 23rd. 

9:00AM - 9:30AM Keynote: [Kimly Scott](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kimly.scott/vizzes) - **Sharing personal experiences through public visualisations** -  I share bespoke visualisations through my public work and through those visualisations, I have shared many aspects of my personal life, sometimes on emotional topics. In my presentation, I will talk about why I openly share my personal experiences with the world via data visualisation, why I chose the visuals I did in these visualisations and how I craft personal stories using data and visuals.

9:30AM - 10:15AM Panel: The Future of Visualization Technology - [Ned Letcher](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-au/profiles/n/ned-letcher), [Paul Hodge](https://datavizguy.com/), [Kenny Gruchalla](https://www.nrel.gov/research/staff/kenny-gruchalla.html)

Over the years, we have accumulated extensive experience in collaborating with partners from diverse domains. For instance, our partnerships with engineers have led to numerous publications, greatly enhancing the awareness and acceptance of visualization within our partner companies. Similar successful collaborations can be seen in the bio-medical and hydrology fields. In this talk, we will report on our experiences, problems, and successes in these collaborations.
