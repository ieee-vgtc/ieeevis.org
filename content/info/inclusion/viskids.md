The IEEE VIS conference is excited to support our VISKids and young families!

VISKids has provided child care grants to VIS conference attendees since 2015. As part of Inclusivity and Diversity at IEEE VIS, VISKids also organize activities at the conference, and has a meeting room at the site. The activities and the room are open to everyone, not just awardees of the child care grant program.

St. Pete Beach is a child-friendly city and Trade Winds Island Grand Resort is a great place to visit with kids! With these initiatives, we hope to facilitate the attendance of those with young families.

## VISKids Child Care Grants 
Grants of up to $750 per family are available for VIS attendees who incur extra expenses while participating in VIS. The grants will be given as a reimbursement for expenses but attendees are responsible for making their own arrangements for child care. If requests exceed available funding, or if additional funding becomes available, preference will be given to students and early career attendees who are presenting at the conference.

### Examples of allowable expenses

* Home-based babysitting or child care services incurred because of attendance at the conference or approved satellite events.
* Babysitting or child care services on location in the city of the conference or approved satellite events.
* Expenses incurred in bringing a caregiver (or family member not attending the meeting acting as a caregiver) to the meeting. This includes airfare/train fare and hotel expenses.
* Travel expenses for the child, limited to reimbursement of airfare/train fare.

### Not elligible for reimbursement

* Travel or other expenses related to the attendeeâ€™s participation in the meeting, including meeting registration, meals, travel to the meeting (including private automobile mileage or tolls), or other expenses the attendee would already be incurring by attending the meeting.
* Meals for the child, toys, and tickets to museums, amusement parks, etc.
* On-going home-based child care expenses.

### Reimbursement proceedure 

* Recipients of a child care grant must submit receipts for reimbursable expenses.
* Reimbursements will be distributed after the conference.
* A reimbursement form will be distributed to grant awardees by email.
