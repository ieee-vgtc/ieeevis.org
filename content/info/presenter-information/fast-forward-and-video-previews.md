Please **read the following instructions carefully** and submit your
25-second video for the online Video Previews by the following deadlines:
- Aug. 22: VIS Full/Short Papers
- Sept. 8: [Partnership](/year/2023/info/call-participation/partnerships) presentations, including TVCG, CG&amp;A, SIGGRAPH, and VR presentations
VIS Full/Short Papers
- Sept 22: All other events.

Video Previews are a great opportunity to publicize your work or event to a wide audience and invite people to join your presentation and read your paper. Video Previews are accessible from the conference website on the VIS YouTube channel prior to, during, and after the conference.

Video Previews are linked from the conference’s webpage and will be compiled into ‘trailers’, one for each session. There will be no Fast-Forward session this year.

<!--
At least one author for each accepted
submission is required to present a 25-second preview of their work
during a Fast Forward (FF) session held at the conference. The same
25-second video supports both purposes: it will be archivally
available as a standalone video with audio track, and it will also be
played during the FF session **without** the audio track while the
author speaks. Voiceover narration in the audio track is strongly
recommended to make the archival video most useful, but is not
mandatory.

## Video Preview Guidelines: 

- Do not include any title slide at the beginning of the video, as we will add a consistent title to the Video Preview containing: the paper title, authors, and session information.
- The video should contain audio narration. We discourage salient music to focus viewers’ attention on the content.
- Subtitles are mandatory to increase accessibility. See the [Talk Recording Guide](/year/2023/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide) for tips on how to create and include subtitles.
- A Video Preview should be self-explaining and self-contained. It should clearly communicate your research and contribution and invite readers to read your paper.
- Other than in recent years’ Fast-Forwards sessions, we discourage humor and trailer-like ‘ads’.
- The video will exist for a long time and can be shared widely by the authors on social media and other channels.

## Do I need to submit a Video Preview? 
If your track is not listed, please check for updates later as all track chairs are finalizing their decisions.


Video Previews are **required** for the following tracks:
- VIS Full Papers
- VIS Short Papers
- Invited [Partnership](/year/2023/info/call-participation/partnerships) Talks (including TVCG, CG&A, SIGGRAPH, and VR)

Video Previews are **optional** for all other tracks and associated events, unless notified otherwise by the chairs for that track/event.

You have **no Video-Preview** to submit for the following tracks:
- Doctor Colloquium

## How to record your video?
Please see the [Talk Recording Guide](/year/2023/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide) on how to format your Video Preview.

 
## How to submit?
- Video Previews will be submitted through our Presentation Material Upload system. The Tech Chairs will send out an email to the corresponding author with a submission-specific upload link. Please see the [Talk Recording Guide](/year/2023/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide) for more information on how to submit your Video Preview.

- Please submit your video file and caption/subtitle file separately and do not bake the subtitles into the video. We will do the integration in a consistent way.


Please **make sure that your video adheres to these specifications otherwise it will not be accepted** and will have to be revised.

**Video Creation:**
There exists a wide range of software to create videos. Here is a list of widely used software to get you started:
- Camtasia: https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html
- OpenShot: https://www.openshot.org 
- Adobe Premiere:  https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/premiere.html	
- iMovie: https://www.apple.com/imovie/ -->

<!-- 
**Automated Subtitles / Captions:**
We ask that you submit a .srt file along with your video. One way to create such a file is to use the automatic YouTube captioning functionality as explained here:  https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554. Generating captions automatically can take some time. Make sure that you manually correct the generated subtitles for errors by directly editing the .srt file in a text editor. If captions cannot be generated manually, you can use the YouTube Studio interface to add captions manually, too.


**Video Encoding:** 
- To encode/re-encode your video in the right format, we recommend to use the free software Handbrake: https://handbrake.fr/ 
- To check that your video is in the right format, we recommend to use the free software MediaInfo: https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo
