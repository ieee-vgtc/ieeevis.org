The high-level goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from across the VIS community to share their knowledge and build collaborations at the intersection of the Machine Learning and Visualization fields, with a focus on learning from user interaction. Our hope in this workshop is to pull expertise from across all fields of VIS in order to generate open discussion about how we currently learn from user interaction and where we can go with future research.

To achieve this goal, we propose a full-day workshop that incorporates paper presentations, keynotes, and free-form discussion. Our goal is to allow for the presentation of cutting-edge research, while also providing participants and speakers with time to exchange ideas and to discuss new research directions.

Visual analytics (VA) systems combine computational support and human cognitive and perceptual skills to explore and analyze data. Many of these systems have been incorporating machine learning (ML) models and algorithms to introduce some level of automation to the analytical process. However, within this relationship, there are a number of aspects that can impact the effectiveness of the human-machine teaming, including: 1) People's domain and system expertise; 2) Human biases, including cognitive and perceptual biases; 3)Trust in ML models and visual representation of data.
Expertise, bias, and trust are intrinsically intertwined. Additionally, visual analytics systems are used in different fields and by people from various backgrounds, with different levels of domain expertise and experience with machine learning and visual analytics tools. This variety of experience and domain expertise among human users has opened the door for new research directions and challenges in the fields of visual analytics and machine learning. Designers who fail to consider the aforementioned diversities might introduce problems to the analysis effectiveness and user experience. Furthermore, experience and domain expertise might affect user trust in visual analytics tools; although, how and why they affect trust is still an open question. Trust will eventually affect how much the users would rely on and use the tool. While users will take advantage of their prior experiences to make better decisions with the assistance of analytic support, they might carry many cognitive biases that can negatively influence their decision-making or analysis process. Recent research shows trust in and reliance on the visual analytics systems/tools as well as user strategies and biases can be directly influenced by domain and system expertise (or lack of expertise). The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to discuss and discover challenges in ML supported visual analytics tools and set the stage for future research directions and collaborations regarding these issues by proposing design guidelines, empirical findings, and VA techniques.

We propose a workshop during VIS 2020 titled "Visualization in Astrophysics: Developing New Methods, Discovering Our Universe, Educating the Earth".
The workshop aims to bring together researchers in astronomy and visualization in addressing emerging directions in visualization for large and complex astronomical datasets.
It will facilitate close interactions among the attendees with the aim of accelerating the convergence between astronomy and visualization research, specifically in the development of practical visualization techniques and tools for large astronomical data.
The workshop aims to have research talks in astronomy and visualization, including talks with planetaria content. It also aims to have moderated discussions and hands-on sessions to discuss potential solutions to mini-challenges involving well-curated astronomy data.

This workshop focuses on data-visualization activities, especiallymethods and challenges for teaching and engaging with data visual-ization concepts, knowledge, and practices. For example,sketchingaids designers to consider alternative ideas; manipulatingtokenshelp students conceptualize quantities for data visualization; userinterviews anddiscussionshelp developers understand requirements.Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts, ofteninclude hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog ordigital tools and materials and more or less well defined protocols.Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualizationactivities in different contexts, including education, visualizationdesign, activism, self-reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration.However, the broad range of contexts and target audiences thatData-Vis activities have been applied to makes it difficult to collectand identify commonalities and build knowledge in a systematicway. Thus, the goals of this workshop arei)start building an un-derstanding and to synthesize protocols and materials used to leaddata vis activities,ii)to bring together researchers, practitioners, andeducators from within and outside of the visualization community,iii)brainstorm, design, experience, and try novel activities, and toiv)discuss issues around goals, methods, audiences, materials, andevaluation for teaching data visualization


## <a name="viscomm"></a> [VisComm: Workshop on Visualization for Communication](https://viscomm.io/)

Our proposed half-day workshop will bring together communicative visualization practitioners with researchers from several fields to address the questions raised by the rapidly growing communicative uses of visualization (e.g. in-news graphics, information graphics). These questions span issues of audience, application, evaluation, understanding and practice. To encourage participation from communities that do not typically attend IEEE Visualization and write academic papers, we will not only accept short papers but also visual case studies, and recruit program committee members from those communities. We have organized this workshop before with great success: at VIS 2018 with around 70 participants and nine papers and posters, and at VIS 2019 with around 60 participants (the room was over capacity, with people turned away) and 13 papers and posters.


## <a name="visfutures"></a> Vis Futures: Design Fiction Methods for Envisioning Tomorrow's Visualizations

The goal of this workshop is to initiate the creation of one or several cards decks through a series of hands-on activities, that will serve as a tool for generating visualization design fictions. Although methods exist to ideate visualization designs, they are not tailored to design fictions. And although some methods exist for generating design fictions, they are not tailored to visualization. We believe that creating a design fiction method for envisioning tomorrow’s visualizations is essential for the research community to think about speculative design. There is also considerable pedagogical value in such a cards game, and these could result in a fun and creative in-class activity for teaching visualization design.


## <a name="visguides"></a> [VisGuides: 3rd Workshop on the Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/c4pgv/)
When: TBD

Contact: alfie.abdulrahman@kcl.ac.uk

Our VisGuides 2020 Workshop proposal focuses on the analysis, design, reflection, and discussion of applicable frameworks to mastering guidelines in visualization by the broader visualization community, embedded in a larger research agenda of visualization theory and practices.

This workshop follows-up the ideas from the IEEE VIS 2016 and 2018 Workshop on Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization (C4PGV) (http://c4pgv.swansea.ac.uk, https://c4pgv.dbvis.de/).

The workshop wants to deliver concrete ideas and meta-guidelines about how the visualization community can contribute to the collection, storage, formulation, and dissemination of guidelines - within and beyond the visualization community. To make this possible, we aim at:
- Discussing work-in-progress and current activities around visualization guidelines.
- Collect a comprehensive list of common and less common guidelines.
- Based on this collection, exercise, create, and discuss a possible framework, or template, or methodology to capture guidelines.
- Discuss a research agenda on how to address open questions around guidelines and how on-going research - in any field of visualization - can contribute to sustainable management and discussion of guidelines.

## <a name="vispsy"></a> IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Psychology

Before 2010, each VIS conference typically featured 0-2 papers on empirical studies. The VisWeek 2010 in Salt Lake City became a turning point, and since then more and more empirical study papers have been presented at VIS. Between 2016 and 2019, there were some 60 empirical study papers in VIS/TVCG tracks. Many young talents who are knowledgeable in both VIS and psychology emerged in the VIS community, while many colleagues in psychology are authoring and co-authoring such papers and attending VIS conferences. It is therefore timely to ask: Is there a need for "Visualization Psychology" as a new interdisciplinary subject? Led by young researchers in both VIS and psychology, this proposed workshop will complement BELIV and VISxVISION by (i) identifying a broad range of visualization phenomena that cannot be adequately explained by existing theories and experiments in VIS and psychology; (ii) Exploring the research questions beyond the scope of visual perception and reaching out to more research findings in psychology in many areas of cognition; and (iii) Enabling visualization and visual analytics to become a rich playground for making fundamental discoveries in psychology and cognitive science in general.
