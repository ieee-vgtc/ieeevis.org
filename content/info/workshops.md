Natural language processing (NLP) has evolved as a promising field for visual analysis and communication. The applications of NLP for supporting various aspects of the visual analysis workflow include helping readers take away key information from charts or dashboards, supporting interaction modalities that help people naturally ``ask" questions of their data, generating data summaries and insight reports, and exploring ways to enrich the semantics of data, among others. With data-driven communication being more important than ever, how do we treat text and language as first-class citizens in helping people see and understand data? How do we couple language and charts to make the data more accessible to a variety of audiences with different needs, capabilities, and skills? As the field of NLP matures, computers now have an increased capability of interpreting language and engaging in conversations with people. But can NLP techniques and interactive visualizations work in concert to support an analytical conversation? As the platforms and channels for exploring data go beyond the desktop to chat interfaces, augmented and virtual reality environments, mobile, and large displays, how do we better understand user intent, modalities, and context to make these interactions more delightful and meaningful?

Addressing these questions calls for research at the intersection of human-computer interaction, information visualization, and NLP, three fields with natural synergies but rather infrequent meetings. This workshop will assemble an interdisciplinary community that promotes collaboration across these fields, explore research opportunities and challenges, and continue to establish an agenda for NLP research specifically for data visualization.

Data is an inescapable part of our lives: it guides commerce, government, and technology, and increasingly determines what lives we can (or cannot) live. Data visualization has a special place within this emerging, data-driven, order: as a tool to inform or persuade mass audiences, guide or enlighten the specialist, or give a voice to the unheard. We therefore pose the question: how can visualization, and visualization research, help us build the worlds we want? This theme, building just and equitable futures, is the motivation behind the third edition of our recurring workshop at IEEE VIS: Visualization for Social Good. Our workshop series has been successful not only at showcasing high-quality socially-minded visualization research from diverse voices, but also in starting important conversations around the role of data visualization as a force for good in society at large. We invite you to join our workshop and growing community on Visualization for Social Good, to navigate conversations about the role of data in human dignity and flourishing.

Often the most transformative ideas and challenges come from unexpected and serendipitous sources. Yet, conferences are not often perceived as a place for non-traditional, controversial, or outré work. We propose to continue the success of the last two year's “alt.VIS'” workshops that borrowed from the long-running and successful “alt.chi” model from the ACM SIGCHI conference. This venue will once again provide an avenue for surfacing creative or critical work that would otherwise not find a home through the standard VIS conference review process.

The VisComm workshop brings together practitioners and researchers from several fields to address the questions raised by the rapidly growing communicative uses of visualization, from internal research and analysis to news graphics to interactive dashboards to standalone static representations in blogs and social media. These questions span audience, application, evaluation, understanding, and practice. To encourage participation from communities that do not typically attend IEEE VIS and write academic papers, we will accept short papers, briefs on works in progress, visual case studies, and recruit program committee members from those communities.

The energy sector is witnessing significant technological progress, primarily driven by the growth of renewable energy, distributed energy resources, and smart grid technologies. This rapid evolution is generating increasingly large, complex data that present substantial challenges for energy systems planning and operations. More research is needed to develop new and innovative visualization methods that can handle the increasing complexity of energy systems and provide diverse stakeholders with the necessary insights to make informed decisions about the future of energy. The EnergyVis 2023 workshop aims to bring together scientists, researchers, and practitioners from the energy and visualization domains to critically assess and discuss energy data visualization in the context of the evolving energy sector. The workshop’s main objectives will be to seed the development of a publishable report on the state-of-the-art and grand challenges in energy data visualization and to develop stronger international collaborations for this important area of multidisciplinary research. With the rapid evolution of energy systems, visualization experts have an essential role in enabling stakeholders to better understand and manage these increasingly complex systems. By expanding the reach of EnergyVis to the broader visualization community at IEEE VIS, we hope to continue the momentum of the past workshops and build a community of experts capable of tackling the visualization challenges of modern energy systems.

With the growth and increasing density of urban areas, new technologies are emerging and data is becoming an essential asset to modern cities. Visualization as a tool for analysis, exploration and communication has become a driving force in the task of unravelling the complex urban fabrics that form our cities. In this workshop series, we want to critically assess this notion and ask how can data and data visualization be used to serve and better understand or even organize urban processes? We are particularly interested in multidisciplinary perspectives, especially on the human-centric component of urban visualizations. In the second workshop at IEEE VIS 2019, we explored roles of citizens in urban visualizations and outlined goals and challenges. Based on these findings, we propose to focus discussions in this 5th workshop on the critical role of urban data governance and its interplay in data and data visualisation: its production, dissemination and use.

Interdisciplinary research between vision science and visualization aims to provide a better scientific understanding of how people interpret visualized data. By studying the cognitive processes involved in visual perception, visualization researchers can gain insight into better-adjusting visualizations to meet user goals. Topics from vision sciences, such as memory, ensemble coding, numerical cognition, color perception, and pattern recognition, can be mapped directly to common challenges encountered in visualization research. At the same time, interacting with visualization researchers exposes vision scientists to novel challenges and research questions in their own field. Building on the growing interest in work at this intersection from both the vision science and visualization communities, this 3rd biennial workshop at IEEE VIS 2023 aims to facilitate collaboration between the vision science and visualization communities by bringing in new researchers, discussing innovative discoveries, and sharing cutting-edge research methods and proposals. Through a multi-stage format, the workshop provides a platform for diverse voices to be heard and new collaborations to be formed.

The provenance-related research interest is growing rapidly within the visualization community. This is evidenced by a dedicated provenance paper track in IEEE VIS 2022, a large number of provenance-related publications in many visualization venues, and several provenance-related workshops at IEEE VIS such as Machine Learning from User Interaction for Visualization and Analytics (MLUI), Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization (TREX), and Workshop on Visualization for AI Explainability (VISxAI). Provenance is also an established topic in several other fields, for example data lineage in database community, interaction log for user studies in Human-Computer Interaction, and workflow history for e-Science. Recently, it gained growing research attention with the recognition of the important of reproducible science.
