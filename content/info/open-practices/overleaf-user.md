## Making a new submission to arXiv

If you are an Overleaf user, the easiest way to prepare a submission is to use the "Submit" button on Overleaf and scroll down to arXiv, download a zip file with all the needed files for your paper, and then click on the Submit button that takes you directly to arXiv pages for a new submission. 

Alternatively, Overleaf provides you a zip file for streamlining your arXiv submission by providing this `.zip` file available for download. You can simply download the `.zip` file and it will have all the files needed, including the `.bbl` file for the references.

## Updating an existing submission to arXiv

When revising a submission, Overleaf does not offer a "*resubmit*" button. You will need to download a `zip` file and replace the files on arXiv that have changed. If you've never done this before, follow the [guidance here](updating-arxiv-post-publication).
