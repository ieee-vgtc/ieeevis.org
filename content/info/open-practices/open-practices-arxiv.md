# How to share a paper via arXiv.org

*Parts of the guidance is based on a document originally written by Joshua Levine.*

**Note**: this document is just a summary, please see [https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit/](https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit/) for the complete information. For information about arXiv’s licensing requirements please see [https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/](https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/).

## Getting started

We have prepared tutorials for you on how to share a paper on arXiv.org depending on your background.

Are you:

* [a first-time arXiv.org user who needs help with registration in the arXiv system?](arxiv-first-time-user)
* [an Overleaf user who needs help getting your paper on the arXiv?](overleaf-user)
* [a previous arXiv user looking for advice specific to IEEE VIS submissions to the arXiv?](vis-specific-arxiv-recommendations)

## Updating the arXiv record post-publication

* Once your paper is processed for publication by IEEE (post final acceptance) and after you receive the DOI, you will need to update your arXiv record [following the guidance here](updating-arxiv-post-publication).
