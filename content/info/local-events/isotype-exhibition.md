2026 is a special anniversary year celebrating the development of a visual language.
One hundred years ago, **Otto Neurath** and his team in Vienna began developing what would become **ISOTYPE** - short for the *International System of Typographic Picture Education*.
The underlying principles of the ISOTYPE system still resonate in today’s visualization guidelines.

## ISOTYPE Exhibition

To remember the work of Otto Neurath and his team, we will present an **ISOTYPE exhibition** in the convention center.
The exhibition will address questions like *What is the history of Isotype*, *How have Isotype visualizations been generated*, and *Who are the people behind Isotype*?
Help us to build an Isotype visualization together!

Visit the exhibition in the **gallery** between level 0 and 1.

**When: Tuesday, Nov 4, to Friday, Nov 7**
