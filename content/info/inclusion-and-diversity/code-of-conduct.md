IEEE VIS is committed to providing an inclusive and harassment-free environment in all interactions regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. This commitment extends to  all IEEE VIS sponsored events and services (virtual conference proceedings, webinars, committee meetings, networking functions, online forums, chat rooms, and social media) and any interaction regardless of affiliation or position. As a community that aims to share ideas and freedom of thought and expression, it is essential that the interaction between attendees take place in an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person by being respectful of all. IEEE VIS does not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, the use of abusive or degrading language or media, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention, and posting unwanted targeted content (e.g., cyberbullying, or content that is sexual or violent in nature). 

Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of threatening behavior is encouraged to immediately report the incident to [ombuds@ieeevis.org](mailto:ombuds@ieeevis.org). All information shared will be kept confidential. In cases where a public response is deemed necessary, the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals consent otherwise.

IEEE VIS reserves the right to take appropriate action to foster an inclusive and respectful environment. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund, at the sole discretion of the conference organizers. In addition, attendees are subject to the [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html).
