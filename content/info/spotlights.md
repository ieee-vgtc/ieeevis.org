### Summary

Visual analytics has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool in a variety of applications. However, the analysis process itself is affected by a variety of uncertainties, such as uncertainty arising from data or computational models. On top of this processing uncertainty, human-computer-interaction introduces yet another type of uncertainty. Any of these uncertainties may influence the decision-making process, especially if they are not known to the user.
Although this problem is quite known, there does not exist a standard workflow that assists in examining and analyzing uncertainties in visual analytics cycles. This may be due to a variety of challenges. On the one hand, visual analytics and the incorporation of uncertainties are not fully understood yet. Especially when considering choices made by humans, the resulting uncertainty is hard to quantify and determine. On the other hand, applications are manifold and each of them introduces specific requirements for the visual analytics process, thus making the standardization difficult.
In this application spotlight, we aim to shed light on the uncertainty-aware visual analytics and provide three different application fields showing where uncertainties arise and how they influence the decision-making process. The spotlight is intended to identify common workflows in all shown applications and foster discussions on how to provide a unified approach to handle uncertainty in visual analytics approaches.

### Summary

Solar activity may impact electric power grids, satellite communications, navigation
systems, and space-borne projects. Space weather simulations model the interplanetary
medium between the Sun and the Earth in efforts to predict solar activity and prevent potentially
catastrophic damage. In this application spotlight session, we focus specifically on work from
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to identify and characterize small-scale fast flow
structures, or bursty bulk flows (BBFs), in space weather simulations. Earthward BBFs are of
interest because they may penetrate spacecraft orbits or the Earth’s magnetosphere and
damage critical infrastructure. However, their small spatial extent and irregular spatiotemporal
frequencies makes it difficult to identify, track, visualize, and quantify their behavior. In this
session, we will discuss multiple techniques to facilitate in-depth analyses of BBFs in simulation
data. One such effort performs “in situ” unsupervised clustering of high-resolution simulation
runs using Variational Gaussian Mixture Models. An interactive visualization framework allows
scientists to analyze clustering results in a post-hoc stage to better understand solar events,
including BBFs. A second technique explores the use of scalar field topology (specifically,
contour tree segmentation) to detect and track BBFs. Statistical tools combined with the results
of these techniques form a more comprehensive picture of BBF activity and their potential
causes.

### Summary
Radiation oncology (RO) is the multidisciplinary medical specialty that addresses cancer treatment. One of its fundamental enablers—from diagnosis to treatment delivery—is visual computing [1]. RO was also one of the first medical visualization applications and is still an active field of vis research. It is a challenging application area that requires the development of approaches spanning the entire basic vis research portfolio. It revolves around multimodal, multiparametric, time-varying, heterogeneous, and uncertain data, involves several users (specialists and patients), and includes a variety of visual computing sub-applications and challenges. Yet, few vis approaches have made it into daily clinical practice and care. This may indicate that current approaches are still complex, not mature, or costly. Closer collaborations between clinic, academia, and industry are necessary to bridge the gap between development of new techniques and their clinical adoption. This is especially crucial, given the future challenges of personalization and predictiveness for more effective treatment, patient participation for more informed treatment, selection of adequate (and explainable) AI methods to deal with the available data volume, and follow-up or inter-patient analysis.
	 	
The structure of our spotlight will include talks from vis and RO specialists, and a structured discussion with the audience to identify problems, challenges, and future directions. We hope to provide a better understanding of how vis can support RO, and act as a starting point for discussing trends and opportunities for joint research.

Currently, she is researching novel interactive visualization approaches for multimodal medical imaging data. Her current focus in this context is on multi-parametric MR acquisitions.
	 	
	 	
#### Talk 3: *Modeling dose-response data in radiation therapy*
	 	 **Vitali Moiseenko** (University of California San Diego, USA): Professor at UCSD where he leads research on biological effects of ionizing radiation with primary focus on analyzing outcomes data in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Having completed his post-doctoral fellowship at the National Radiological Protection Board, UK, Vitali obtained his board certification from the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine in 2004. He has extensively published on the topic of radiation-induced toxicity in cancer patients with emphasis on adverse effects seen in patients treated for genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and head&neck cancers. At the time of preparing this biosketch Vitali has 147 peer-reviewed papers, 9 book chapters and 2 Task Group reports published. Vitali has served on the American Association of Physicists in Medicine/American Society for Radiation Oncology (AAPM/ASTRO) Working Groups, QUANTEC (Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic), and HyTEC (High Dose per Fraction, Hypofractionated Treatment Effects in the Clinic), which were set to summarize and produce consensus guidelines for normal tissue tolerance following conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated radiation therapy. His current interest is finding ways to make radiation therapy personalized by accounting for patient-specific features, from biomarkers to anatomic signatures. In particular, visual analytics may provide tools to predict how patients respond to radiotherapy when commonly used metrics omit features impacting response.

### Summary
Planetariums have been at the forefront of science education since their inception 100 years ago. While initially focussed on accurately depicting the stars in the night sky to teach astronomy to planetarium visitors, the recent two decades have seen a rapid transition of this immersive, but relatively static display environment. The planetarium now encompasses the dissemination of non-astronomical topics, and employs sophisticated interactive immersive software suites. The current focus of these environments is on public visitors while the usage of the almost 3000 planetariums worldwide for scientific purposes remains largely untapped. While visualization techniques have evolved rapidly in the space of flat monitor and virtual reality environments, planetariums with their large-scale non-reciprocal display surfaces pose some unique rendering and interaction challenges.
This application spotlight will feature speakers with experience from the visualization domain and the planetarium world that introduce some of the terminology of the field, highlight the ongoing endeavors in this rapidly evolving field, as well as discuss some of the open challenges with a call-to-action to the community to utilize more of these underappreciated display environments. A portion of the application spotlight will be dedicated to an interactive discussion of the speakers with the audiences.

### Summary
The energy sector faces many deep uncertainties about the future, including climate change, growth in energy demand and technologic capabilities, and cybersecurity. Deep uncertainty is characterized by a level of uncertainty where we do not know how to model a system or how to value the desirability of outcomes. Methodologies exist to evaluate the level of deep of uncertainty in a problem, and to help reason on risk and decisions; however, traditional making and visualization techniques may not be applicable when facing deeply uncertain problems. In this application spotlight, we will give an introduction to deep uncertainty including characterization of levels of deep uncertainty and how to approach unknowns to a problem. We will highlight the challenges of visualizing and decision making with deep uncertainty, and potential solutions to ensure it is properly captured and communicated to decisionmakers and stakeholders. We propose an overview of deep uncertainty and the unique challenges it poses, the need for decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) methodologies, and challenges in creating visualizations that capture such a wide range of uncertainty. We will follow with several lighting talk topics, including a use case applying DMDU methods to a campus energy resilience planning problem utilizing quantitative modeling, and a discussion of visualization methods that are best suited to capturing deep uncertainty. We will bring in deep uncertainty experts from Rand, as well as highlight work currently happening at NREL on both decision making and visualization. We will finish with a 30 guided discussion, with the goal of encouraging audience participation.
