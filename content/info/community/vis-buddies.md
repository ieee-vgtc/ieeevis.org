## Welcome to the VIS 2026 buddies program

VisBuddies brings together new and returning VIS attendees with similar interests. For *newcomers*, this is a chance to meet experienced researchers in the field. For *returning attendees*, it is a chance to meet new members joining VIS and welcome them into our community.

Example VisBuddies activities include:
* Build connections between experienced researchers and new members of the VIS community
* Discuss interesting sessions to attend
* Share tips on successful research
