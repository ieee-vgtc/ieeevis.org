### Best Papers

**"They Aren't Built For Me": An Exploratory Study of Strategies for Measurement of Graphical Primitives in Tactile Graphics**<br />
by Areen Khalaila, Lane Harrison, Nam Wook Kim, & Dylan Cashman<br />
**Session**: Best Full Papers [Tuesday (Nov 4), 2:00pm - 3:15pm (CET)]

Developing effective tactile graphics for visually impaired people is an important yet under-explored area. This paper presents a study that investigates basic graphical perception experiments with visually impaired participants. It highlights the gaps between the guidelines for visual primitives and the needs of visually impaired people. It presents the core difficulties of visually impaired people based on an in-depth study, including thought-provoking discussions. Moreover, this work provides design guidelines that serve as solid foundations for this important and emergent area and identifies challenges that open up research opportunities. 


**ReVISit 2: A Full Experiment Life Cycle User Study Framework**<br />
by Zach Cutler, Jack Wilburn, Hilson Shrestha, Yiren Ding, Brian Bollen, Khandaker Abrar Nadib, Tingying He, Andrew McNutt, Lane Harrison, & Alexander Lex<br />
**Session**: Best Full Papers [Tuesday (Nov 4), 2:00pm - 3:15pm (CET)]

This paper presents the latest incarnation of the reVisit tool, a tool for making user studies more approachable and scientifically sound. It includes many components valuable to the community that can be expected to be widely used, essentially providing a service to the visualization community. It may lead to user studies that are easier to access, more streamlined, and better reproducible. The authors provide an elegant framework, a nice implementation, and comprehensive documentation, as well as a website and open-source repositories with interactive demos. This research will give visualization user studies more visibility by reducing the burden of open-source study design, materials, and results.


**Beyond Problem Solving: Framing and Problem–Solution Co-Evolution in Data Visualization Design**<br />
by Paul Parsons & Prakash Chandra Shukla<br />
**Session**: Best Full Papers [Tuesday (Nov 4), 2:00pm - 3:15pm (CET)]

This paper presents a theoretical framing and qualitative study on how visualization design professionals co-evolve visualization problems and solutions. It identifies a critical gap in current design models: the need for problem framing and solution development to co-evolve, rather than being treated as separate stages. The authors compellingly validate this intuition through well-designed studies, providing empirical evidence, actionable strategies, and valuable implications for visualization theory, enriching both research and practice. 


**Causality-based Visual Analytics of Sentiment Contagion in Social Media Topics**<br />
by Renzhong Li, Yuchen Lin, Shuainan Ye, Buwei Zhou, Zhining Kang, Tai-Quan Peng, Wenhao Fu, Yingcai Wu, & Tan Tang<br />
**Session**: Best Full Papers & Test of Time Awards [Tuesday (Nov 4), 3:45pm - 5:00pm (CET)]

This paper makes a timely and technically rigorous contribution to visual analytics by introducing a novel, causality-based approach to modeling sentiment contagion across social media topics. It combines scalable causal inference with an innovative, map-inspired visualization that encodes time, hierarchy, and sentiment flow, enabling intuitive exploration of complex social dynamics. With its methodological depth, thoughtful design, and real-world applicability, the paper makes valuable contributions to both the methodological and application sides. The comprehensive validation, including use cases, comparative user studies, and expert interviews, demonstrates the system’s usability and its real-world relevance. 


**NLI4VolVis: Natural Language Interaction for Volume Visualization via LLM Multi-Agents and Editable 3D Gaussian Splatting**<br />
by Kuangshi Ai, Kaiyuan Tang, & Chaoli Wang<br />
**Session**: Best Full Papers & Test of Time Awards [Tuesday (Nov 4), 3:45pm - 5:00pm (CET)]

This paper presents a novel and well-engineered system that integrates up-to-date volume segmentation, learnable 3D Gaussian splatting, open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding, and LLM-based agents to allow users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. The proposed framework offers a promising step forward in enabling intuitive interaction with real-time 3D volume visualizations through natural language interfaces, making volume rendering accessible even to non-expert users. Its practical impact is documented through a well-designed user study. Moreover, the authors open-source their system, which can benefit the community.

### Best Papers

**Toward a Logic of Generalization about Visualization as a Decision Aid**<br />
by Alex Kale<br />
**Session**: VGTC Awards & Best Short Papers [Tuesday (Nov 4), 11:15am - 12:30pm (CET)]

This interesting and thought-provoking paper brings forward formalisms from decision theory in ways that are accessible and actionable for visualization researchers. It clearly articulates how the visualization community approaches generalization and the logic that underlies it. The paper stands to significantly improve the ways in which we explore and evaluate how visualizations influence decision-making by holistically framing decision-making and its related components. Further, it provides a strong example of how research can introduce established theory to the research community. 


**The Perils of Chart Deception: How Misleading Visualizations Affect Vision-Language Models**<br />
by Ridwan Mahbub, Mohammed Saidul Islam, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Mizanur Rahman, Mir Tafseer Nayeem, and Enamul Hoque<br />
**Session**: VGTC Awards & Best Short Papers [Tuesday (Nov 4), 11:15am - 12:30pm (CET)]

The paper demonstrates that many of the same deceptive features of charts that can fool a human will also fool Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Through a novel large-scale study (100 charts, 8 deception types, 10 VLMs, and 16k responses), the work characterizes the susceptibility of models to different forms of deception. The results provide an important baseline assessment of the inability of state-of-the-art VLMs in detecting many deceptive chart features (e.g., inverted axes). As critically, the work provides a dataset for the evaluation of future VLMs.

### Best Poster

**Designing a Glyph-Based Hierarchical Visualization for Orders of Magnitude Values**<br />
by Katerina Batziakoudi, Ambre Assor, Christophe Bortolaso, & Jean-Daniel Fekete

This poster introduces a novel hierarchical visualization approach designed for showing orders of magnitude. The authors propose a new visual representation based on the mantissa–exponent concept. The result is a compelling and thoughtful contribution that clarifies the shortcomings of prior approaches and offers a practical and scalable solution. The poster design is clear and well-organized, effectively showcasing the visualization design.
