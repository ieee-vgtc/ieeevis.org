The IEEE VIS 2021 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

The presentation of posters will take place in a mainly virtual event online. There will be 1-2 dedicated poster sessions in which poster authors can virtually meet and discuss their work with conference participants. An additional web presence of posters will replace the traditional physical installation of poster boards. More concrete details will follow soon, with the goal of creating an engaging atmosphere consistent with past in-person poster sessions.   

In addition to the electronic poster and its virtual presentation, the submitted two-page summary will be included in the electronic conference proceedings. 

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to


* research exploring new problems or areas,
* results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in the VGTC conference two-column format in line with the [IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference), using the poster format.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations should be included.

Authors whose posters are accepted for IEEE VIS will be asked to refine their two-page summaries based upon feedback from reviewers and submit an electronic poster.

The electronic posters will be created using a provided web-based interface. Access to this interface will be granted after the two-page summary has been accepted for presentation.

Presenters are also encouraged to submit an accompanying preview video. Video preview is a great opportunity to publicize your work or event to a wide audience. A video preview should be self-explaining and self-contained. Technical characteristics of the video will be made available at [http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/presenter-information/fast-forward-and-video-previews](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/presenter-information/fast-forward-and-video-previews)

At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves, or is a summary of previously presented/published work with clear attribution.
