We solicit submissions to the doctoral colloquium (DC) for IEEE VIS 2020. The DC is a single-day by invitation-only event taking place the day before IEEE VIS on Oct. 25, 2020. Ph.D. students present their proposed dissertation work and receive feedback from leading senior visualization researchers. We invite contributions from student communities involved in all areas of visualization.

The colloquium will allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers. Students can expect helpful feedback and fresh perspectives on their research topics and possible career paths and will have the opportunity to interact closely with expert researchers in their field. The colloquium will support community-building by connecting early-career and established researchers.

The DC call is open to all Ph.D. students — regardless of whether they are presenting research work at the main VIS conference or not. While we welcome all applications, preference will be given to students who will gain most from the experience, meaning students who are in the process of formulating their dissertation topic or who have just formulated a dissertation topic. In North American terms, this typically corresponds to students who will or have recently had their thesis proposal approved. Students who are very early in their studies and students who plan to graduate shortly after the VIS conference may not benefit as much from external feedback in the DC as it may come too early to be useful or too late to be incorporated. 

All research topics suitable for the IEEE VAST, IEEE InfoVis, and IEEE SciVis main programs as well as associated workshops and symposia are appropriate for the Doctoral Colloquium. The Doctoral Colloquium strongly commits to achieving diversity among the student participants, including diversity across research groups and geographical area. Hence, typically no more than one participant per institution are eligible for participation. 

## Format
The colloquium will consist of both parallel sessions of student presentations as well as general discussions with the expert panelists. A catered lunch and a roundtable discussion session will give student participants the opportunity to interact more informally with panelists.

Only selected applicants will be allowed to participate in the colloquium and will be expected to attend the full day of events.

## Funding
Contingent upon pending requests for external sponsorship of the VIS DC, we may be able to partially fund the travel, conference registration, and lodging for accepted DC student participants.

## Submissions
The deadline for DC submissions is **Wednesday, May 13, 2020, 5pm PDT**.  
Notification: July 9, 2020.

Applicants to the Doctoral Colloquium should submit:
*	A four-page summary describing their PhD research, including the problem being addressed, methodology and plan of research, a description of the progress to date, and the type of input expected from DC panelists. The four-page limit does not include references	. The writing should be in a proposal format in order to facilitate feedback from the panelists as to the validity of your problem and the efficacy of your approach. The structure should follow the format used by most universities for a thesis proposal: an Introduction, a Related Work, Preliminary Methods, Preliminary Results, Proposed Work, Discussion, Questions for the Panel, and Conclusion. The summary should have a single author – the student submitting the entry. Please distinguish clearly between work that has been accomplished and that remains to be completed. As indicated above, the summary should identify clearly, in a separate section, the feedback the student expects from the panel.
*	A short, signed statement (pdf or text) from the student’s advisor supporting the student’s attendance at the colloquium and confirming that the student is in a good position to benefit from participating. It has to include information about the stage of the PhD project and expected finish date. Note that this should NOT be a letter of recommendation; a brief statement of support is sufficient. The statement should be appended to the student submission pdf file, not sent via email.

Please submit [via PCS](http://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc).

Formatting guidelines and LaTeX/Word templates can be found [here](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).

Student submissions will be peer-reviewed and selections will be made on the basis of their contribution to the colloquium goals, strength of research direction, and the advisor’s assessment. Accepted submissions will be printed for colloquium participants.
