      **Publication Venue**

      Full papers accepted to IEEE VIS will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and will be indexed in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/). Plan S has provided verbal approval of IEEE’s hybrid journal portfolio, including TVCG, for transformative status, allowing TVCG to accept articles from authors whose funders require [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) compliance.

## Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria

As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their scientific quality and novelty, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. After the initial notification of review results, selected papers are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle: only papers that improve according to the required changes will be accepted after the second round review.

IEEE VIS 2024 also features a separate short papers track. You can find more information in the [call for participation for short papers](shortpapers).

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the [paper submission guidelines](paper-submission-guidelines).

Reviewers should be familiar with the [guidelines for reviewing papers for VIS](review-instructions).

## Accessibility

We highly recommend screen reader accessible final submissions. Please see the [VIS Accessibility Guide](/year/2024/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible) to learn how you can make your contribution accessible.

## Open Access Policy

Visualization research is best communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open-access repository in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. We also recommend that authors include sufficient supplemental materials with their submission so that their work can be easily scrutinized and used or extended by future researchers and practitioners. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open-access repository and recommendations on sharing supplemental materials, please see the [VIS Open Practices Guidelines](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/open-practices/open-practices). Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules concerning Plan S compliance: impacted authors should check and comply with their respective organizational rules.
