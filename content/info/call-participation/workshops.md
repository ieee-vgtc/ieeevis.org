We solicit workshops related to all areas of visualization. They provide an informal setting in IEEE VIS for participants to discuss advanced topics in visualization, involve experts in the field, disseminate work in progress, and promote new ideas. Workshops at IEEE VIS are open to all registered attendees (“invitation only” workshops will not be approved).

## Important Dates

* Proposal Submission               **Sunday February 24, 2024**
* Notification                      **Friday March 15, 2024**
* Final Submission of Summaries	    **Thursday August 1, 2024**

All deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) AoE **Anywhere on Earth [(AoE)](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth) (new for 2023)**.

## Workshops should:

* emphasize emerging ideas, concepts, or technologies that are currently too nascent or too interdisciplinary for a full symposium;

* bring together experts on a subject to create a report, white-paper, or proposal that requires interactive work sessions, and that is of potential interest to a substantial segment of the visualization community; and/or

* encourage information flow not solely from the presenters to the audience, but rather engage the participation of all attendees, for example, through collective or small group discussions.

Possible topics may include emerging or persisting problems, development of research agendas, networking for finding common interests and possibilities for cooperation, interaction with domain experts involving analysis of their domain problems, contests on solving specific visualization problems, etc.

In choosing workshop topics to propose, please consider the list of workshops that will be pre-approved and try to avoid large overlaps. The list of the pre-approved workshops will be published as soon as it becomes available.

Note that workshops remain extremely well attended, but as new associated events and publication formats are introduced to VIS, the number of submitted papers may drop from previous years. So a more interactive format (rather than one based mainly on presentations of submitted papers) is encouraged.


## Submission requirements

Workshop proposals should include:

* a title,
* the contact details of the organizers,
* a brief description of the organizers’ background, related publications, and research,
* the intended format (i.e., in person, remote, or hybrid),
* the planned activities (e.g., mainly talks, mainly interactive sessions, a mix), including an outline schedule for the program&mdash;workshops are strongly encouraged, though not required, to consider ways to interactively engage all participants,
* the intended result and impact of the workshop,
* **NEW:** a brief justification for why this workshop is necessary (e.g., why would the topic benefit from a more informal setting, in what ways is the topic emergent or a relatively poor fit for the main conference program, etc.),
* a chosen measure for a successful CFP (e.g., number of submissions), possibly including an outline for a “backup policy” (e.g., changing the workshop format, or voluntarily withdrawing the workshop before acceptance notification is sent, but should not require the workshop organizers to submit emergency papers to their own workshop),
* a statement of the organization and the development of the list of participants (intended size, detailed selection procedures, and timeline for finalizing workshop presenters),
* a list of any special technology needed,
* the plan for publication (see the classes listed below),
* the number of poster slots requested, if the workshop intends to feature posters, and
* the proposed dates for the call for participation, author notification, and camera-ready deadlines (author notification must be prior to the early registration deadline for IEEE VIS; for inclusion of materials on IEEE Xplore and/or the downloadable proceedings, the camera-ready deadline must be prior to **August 19, 2024**).

Because the number of workshop time slots is limited, half-day workshop proposals are **strongly encouraged**. However, well-justified full-day proposals will also be considered. Full-day proposals may optionally state what changes would be implemented to allow the workshop schedule to fit within a half day.

If the proposed workshop is a follow-up of a previous workshop, please include an evaluation of the prior workshop(s) including a discussion of the results and evidence of impact.

**The proposal should not exceed four pages.** Please visit [VGTC website](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference) for formatting details and submit via [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc).


## Publication strategy

If papers or position papers are foreseen according to the planned workshop, the proposal should state explicitly whether and how the papers or position statements will be published. Some examples of common publication strategies are:

* _Regular publication_ (similar to small conferences):
    - papers are available online at a central digital library with DOI (e.g., IEEE Xplore) or proceedings published in a different way
    - papers are part of the downloadable proceedings
    - papers are considered archival

    Accepted workshop papers can contribute to VIS full paper submissions in a future year. But, such submissions should not contain verbatim copies of previous content. Furthermore, any full paper submission to VIS must stand as its own contribution.

* _Short position statements / work in progress notes_ (similar to posters):
    - papers may or may not be available at a central digital library (with DOI); proceedings could also be published in a different way
    - papers may be available on the workshop’s webpage
    - papers may or may not be a part of the downloadable proceedings
    - papers are not considered archival but could be cited

    Re-use of the content in a follow-up publication is fully allowed, also in form of conference papers. Example: [Death of the Desktop workshop 2014](http://dataphys.org/workshops/vis14/).

* _Semi-public notes_:
    - papers are not available at a central digital library
    - papers may be available on the workshop’s webpage
    - papers may or may not be a part of the downloadable proceedings
    - papers are not considered archival but could be cited

    Re-use of the content in a follow-up publication is fully allowed, also in form of conference papers.

* _Notes only for use at the workshop_:
    - papers are not available online at a central location
    - papers are not a part of the downloadable proceedings
    - papers are not considered archival and should not be cited

    Re-use of the content in a follow-up publication is fully allowed, also in form of conference papers.

### Attendance

At least one author for each paper must register and attend the conference in person or virtually. If you have exceptional circumstances and none of the authors can attend in person please contact the conference committee as soon as possible at [info@ieeevis.org](mailto:info@ieeevis.org).

## Evaluation criteria

The aim of workshops is to include a variety of topics and a healthy mix of new and recurring events. Repeat submissions will be judged in part by the success of the previous workshop. Workshop success will be judged subjectively, but popularity, research impact, visibility, and attendee feedback will all be taken into account. Specifically, the workshop proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

* the potential for inspiring people, being influential, and opening new lines of research,
* **NEW:** the degree to which the workshop provides a more interactive environment for participants—all things being equal, preference will be given to workshops that emphasize participant interaction,
* the coherence of the proposed topic and the degree to which it would benefit from a workshop environment,
* if this workshop is a repeat submission, its previous success,
* the ability to attract people and make them excited about the workshop,
* the appropriateness with respect to IEEE VIS topics,
* if this workshop has special needs, the feasibility of the proposed plan including financial, logistics, scheduling, and coordination impact.

The workshop chairs will balance the proposed topics in order to support the diversity of topics within IEEE VIS and complement the main program.

Organizers should consider what steps they will take to encourage a diversity of participants in their workshop (e.g., a balance of experience, background, gender, etc.) with the aim of making participation as inclusive as possible.

If accepted, workshops are required to prepare a short summary (50&ndash;100 words) for the workshops website and the web program.


## Workshop Support

The workshop organizers will receive the following support from the VIS conference:

* one complimentary 1-day registration for an invited speaker,
* room and AV support suitable for around 100 attendees,
* food and beverages for attendees: coffee breaks throughout the day, Sunday evening opening reception, space in the poster display area, if requested (from limited pool set aside for standard workshops; available space depends on the specifics of the venue; early requests given priority over late requests),
* PCS (Precision Conference Solutions) support for managing submissions and the review process,
* inclusion of the workshop materials or proceedings in the downloadable conference proceedings for dissemination to attendees of the conference and/or in IEEE Xplore, if requested (materials must be provided by August 19, 2024),
* IEEE Xplore Digital Library publication of the workshop proceedings, if requested (considered archival).

Please check the conference website for upcoming information concerning available funds for special purposes, such as supporting diversity. If the requirements of the workshop exceed this default support, the workshop organizers are expected to coordinate with the workshop chairs and possibly raise funds to support the workshop activities. Fundraising plans must be discussed with the workshop and supporters chairs prior to contacting any potential funder. For more information, see the guidelines for [Financial and Coordination Policies for IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/governance/coordination).

Note that each workshop participant will need to register to attend the IEEE 
VIS conference.
