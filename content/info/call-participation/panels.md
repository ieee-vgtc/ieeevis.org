IEEE VIS 2024 Panels should address contemporary, important and/or controversial debates, issues and applications in visualization and related topics. In particular, we invite panels that:

* Bring together interest groups and discuss cross-cutting issues that are of interest to the broad VIS community
* Connect visualization with interesting application fields
* Open up interdisciplinary debates that explore the role of visualization in science and society 
* Bring visualization researchers together with potential stakeholders of visualization
* Consist of experts in fields that discuss and/or debate relevant concepts that broaden the intellectual scope of visualization research (e.g., perceptual psychology, cognitive psychology, design research, color theory, user-interface design)
* Raise controversial, important, or emerging debates in relation to visualization

Panelists should be experts in their fields who can discuss the challenges of visualization, and engage the audience and fellow panel members in a stimulating, interactive debate.

VIS Panels value diversity in perspective, opinion, and representation. The most interesting sessions are the ones where there are many different perspectives. In selecting panels, the committee will favor panels that reflect and broaden the breadth and richness of the VIS community. In curating a panel, we urge you to consider speakers that come from a variety of intellectual backgrounds, with diverse genders, ethnicities, and nationalities.


## Panel Logistics

Panels are scheduled for the duration of an entire paper session; panel proposals should thus target 90 minutes total duration, including questions and discussion. We strongly recommend that in order to keep to time, the chair of the panel is not one of the panel speakers and instead moderates the discussion. We also recommend organizers to encourage lively discussions both within the panelists and the audience and ensure that there is sufficient time for such interactions to take place.



## Submissions

Panel proposals are 1-page (approx. 500 words) documents that should outline:

1. A **description of the panel topic**. This should provide the title of the panel and describe the core topic/question/issue that the panel is addressing. In cases where the panel follows up on the topic of a previously held panel, we ask the organizers to point this out and to detail the advances expected from the follow-up.
2. A  **short description of the panel format and anticipated schedule**. This should be a brief description to outline the time to be spent on panelist presentations, and mechanisms for encouraging audience participation. Based on audience feedback, the duration of panelist presentations should allow ample time for intra-panel discussion and discussions between the panel and the audience.
3. A  **list of prospective panelists**. Organizers should list the names and details (institution, contact info) of potential panelists indicating how they envision the panelists contributing to the discussion. Panels generally involve 4 to 5 panelists. We encourage that by the proposal deadline, organizers have already been in touch with the panelists and have provisional commitments. The final confirmed list of panelists will be required by the camera-ready deadline.
4. The **list of organizers**. This should list the organizers along with their brief 3-5 sentence bios.


Submissions should be submitted via [PCS](http://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc/). Please note the [formatting guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference) when preparing your submission.
