Do you want to meet people who share the same interests with you, discuss a topic that you care about or that brings the visualization community forward, or share viewpoints and experiences to foster community building? If yes, organize a meetup!

### What is a meetup?

Meetups are an excellent forum to discuss a wide range of topics related to visualization. For example, if you are an experienced researcher or practitioner, consider submitting a proposal to share your knowledge in an informal setting with conference participants. Meetups welcome cross disciplinary proposals and proposals that are devoted to particular discipline methods. For example, some recent meetups have included opportunities to discuss topics related to sonification to augment visualization, machine learning for big data, career plans for women, the connection between art and science, deceptive visualizations, inclusion and diversity from both academic and corporate perspectives, and even organizing a joint bike trip (Velo Club de VIS). VIS2019 is eager to expand its meetup sessions and will consider proposals given room availability. All meetups are public and open to everyone (the meetup organizers need to register at the conference).

### What do you get?

The meetup chairs will take care of reserving a room that fits your needs, finding a time slot, making sure that the equipment you need is there, advertising the meetup via social media, and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

### What information should a meetup proposal include?

* a title,
* a responsible person (name, contact information),
* a brief description of the topic to be addressed,
* prospective audience and a foreseen number of participants,
* room equipment requirements and,
* preferences and constraints for meetup schedule (if applicable).

### Whom to contact and where to submit the proposals?

Submissions should be emailed to
[meetups@ieeevis.org](mailto:meetups@ieeevis.org).

### When to submit?

To best accommodate the needs ranging from early planned proposals to impromptu meetups on site, we accept different types of submission, depending on the period when the idea of a meetup sparks: early submissions, rolling submissions, and impromptu meetups. All three are equally good, although later submissions will be considered subject to room availability.

| Early Submission Deadline | **Friday, August 2, 2019** | 
| Notification | **Friday, August 9, 2019** |

Note: Meetups submission made by Agust 2 may have the chance to be inluded in programme and fast forward. 

*Rolling submission*: Submissions after the early submission deadline will be considered subject to room availability. Later submissions will be processed and notified within a couple of days.

| Rolling Submission | **From August 2, 2019 to October 19, 2019** | 
| Notification | **Within a few days** |

*Impromptu meetup!* We also encourage impromptu meetups to be organized during the conference itself. Please contact the chairs by email or in person during the conference in order to secure a conference room and time slot.

| Notification | **Within a couple of hours** |
