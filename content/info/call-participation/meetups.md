Do you want to meet people who share the same interests as you, discuss a topic that you care about or that brings the visualization community forward, or share viewpoints and experiences to foster community building? If yes, organize a meetup!



### What is a meetup?

Meetups are an excellent forum to discuss a wide range of topics related to visualization. For example, if you are an experienced researcher or practitioner, consider submitting a proposal to share your knowledge in an informal setting with conference participants. Meetups welcome cross-disciplinary proposals and proposals that are devoted to particular discipline methods. For example, some recent meetups have included opportunities to discuss topics related to sonification for augmenting visualization, machine learning for big data, inclusion and diversity in visualization research, work-life balance topics, the connection between art and science, and deceptive visualizations. VIS2024 is eager to expand its meetup sessions and will consider proposals given technology resources and time availability. All meetups are public and open to everyone.



### What do you get?

The meetup chairs will take care of reserving a room that fits your needs, finding a time slot, making sure that the equipment you need is there, advertising the meetup via social media, and making sure that everything runs smoothly.



### What information should a meetup proposal include?

* a title,
* a responsible person (name, contact information),
* a brief description of the topic to be addressed (less than 200 words),
* prospective audience and a foreseen number of participants,
* room equipment requirements,
* preferences and constraints for meetup schedule (if applicable). 



### Whom to contact and where to submit the proposals?

Submissions should be emailed to
[meetups@ieeevis.org](mailto:meetups@ieeevis.org).
