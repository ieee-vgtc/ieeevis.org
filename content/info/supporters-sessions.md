The Supporters Forum features top supporters of IEEE VIS from Industry and Academia. Learn about them in brief presentations and then join us for a panel where we will discuss collaboration between industry and the visualization research community. The panel includes an array of perspectives on VIS in industry, including from experienced practitioners in academic collaboration, industrial labs, earlier career industrial researchers, and growing VIS departments. In the panel, we will discuss challenges of using visualization in industry and how the research community can best prepare our students for the type of data jobs where they’re needed. 

The session will take place on Tuesday, 3:45pm - 5:00pm, right after the conference keynote in the same hall. Join us and discuss with our supporters.
